That sounds fine for stopping deepfake porn, but the liability language is a trap. It targets anyone who \"makes available\" a tool that is primarily used for replicas.  \n​The Problem: If you release a TTS model or a voice-conversion RVC model on HuggingFace, and someone else uses it to fake a celebrity, you (the dev) can be liable for statutory damages ($5k-$25k per violation).\n​There is no Section 230 protection here. This effectively makes hosting open weights for audio models a legal s*icide mission unless you are OpenAI or Google.\n\nWhat I did:\nI contacted my reps email to flag this as an \"innovation killer.\" If you run a repo or care about open weights, you might want to do the same. We need them to add a \"Safe Harbor\" for tool devs.\n\nS.1367 - 119th Congress (2025-2026): NO FAKES Act of 2025 | Congress.gov | Library of Congress https://share.google/u6dpy7ZQDvZWUrlfc",

If you're a developer and you release a tool that can be used to impersonate people, you're responsible.\n\nSo let's say you're all against that, alright, fair, what's the next step? What laws, what enforcement, how do we stop this?\n\nBecause \"we just have to learn to live with it\" is not gonna fly.",

Because everytime someone advertises a TTS related thing, they bold 1000 times EAZY ONE SHOT VOICE REPLICATION as if that's its only use. This thing passes, then just take that out of your description and add a warning that you're expected to own the rights to any likeness you're duplicating.\n\nThis worry is pretty same as Photoshop being able to edit images you don't own. Photoshop doesn't spam 1000 times that you can steal copyright and must have written somewhere that copyright laws are your own problem somewhere.\n\nSo all that's left is probably actual heinous sites on the chopping block who should definitely be liable if their advertising is spamming how easy their tool will allow you to rip off likenesses and generate infringing content.",

Turns out Jensen said \"AI\" exactly 121 times in the CES 2025 keynote.\n\nI used [https://github.com/OpenAgentPlatform/Dive](https://github.com/OpenAgentPlatform/Dive) (open-source MCP client) + two MCPs I made:\n\n\\- [https://github.com/kevinwatt/yt-dlp-mcp](https://github.com/kevinwatt/yt-dlp-mcp) \\- YouTube download  \n\\- [https://github.com/kevinwatt/ffmpeg-mcp-lite](https://github.com/kevinwatt/ffmpeg-mcp-lite) \\- video editing\n\n**One prompt:**\n\n\u0026gt;Task: Create a compilation video of every exact moment Jensen Huang says \"AI\".  \nVideo source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NBILspM4c4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NBILspM4c4)\n\n\u0026gt;**Instructions:**\n\n\u0026gt;Download video in 720p + subtitles in JSON3 format (word-level timestamps)\n\n\u0026gt;Parse JSON3 to find every \"AI\" instance with precise start/end times\n\n\u0026gt;Use ffmpeg to cut clips (\\~50-100ms padding for natural sound)\n\n\u0026gt;Concatenate all clips chronologically\n\n\u0026gt;Output: Jensen\\_CES\\_AI.mp4\n\nDive chained the two MCPs together - download → parse timestamps → cut 121 clips → merge.

See the [Chat Template documentation](https://docs.liquid.ai/lfm/key-concepts/chat-template) for details. Example:\n\n```\n\u003c|startoftext|\u003e\u003c|im_start|\u003esystem\nYou are a helpful assistant trained by Liquid AI.\u003c|im_end|\u003e\n\u003c|im_start|\u003euser\nWhat is C. elegans?\u003c|im_end|\u003e\n\u003c|im_start|\u003eassistant\n```\n\nYou can use [`tokenizer.apply_chat_template()`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/chat_templating#using-applychattemplate) to format your messages automatically.\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/LiquidAI/LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct#tool-use) Tool Use\n\nLFM2.5 supports function calling as follows:\n\n1.   **Function definition**: We recommend providing the list of tools as a JSON object in the system prompt. You can also use the [`tokenizer.apply_chat_template()`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/chat_extras#passing-tools) function with tools.\n2.   **Function call**: By default, LFM2.5 writes Pythonic function calls (a Python list between `\u003c|tool_call_start|\u003e` and `\u003c|tool_call_end|\u003e` special tokens), as the assistant answer. You can override this behavior by asking the model to output JSON function calls in the system prompt.\n3.   **Function execution**: The function call is executed, and the result is returned as a \"tool\" role.\n4.   **Final answer**: LFM2 interprets the outcome of the function call to address the original user prompt in plain text.\n\nSee the [Tool Use documentation](https://docs.liquid.ai/lfm/key-concepts/tool-use) for the full guide. Example:\n\n```\n\u003c|startoftext|\u003e\u003c|im_start|\u003esystem\nList of tools: [{\"name\": \"get_candidate_status\", \"description\": \"Retrieves the current status of a candidate in the recruitment process\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"candidate_id\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Unique identifier for the candidate\"}}, \"required\": [\"candidate_id\"]}}]\u003c|im_end|\u003e\n\u003c|im_start|\u003euser\nWhat is the current status of candidate ID 12345?\u003c|im_end|\u003e\n\u003c|im_start|\u003eassistant\n\u003c|tool_call_start|\u003e[get_candidate_status(candidate_id=\"12345\")]\u003c|tool_call_end|\u003eChecking the current status of candidate ID 12345.\u003c|im_end|\u003e\n\u003c|im_start|\u003etool\n[{\"candidate_id\": \"12345\", \"status\": \"Interview Scheduled\", \"position\": \"Clinical Research Associate\", \"date\": \"2023-11-20\"}]\u003c|im_end|\u003e\n\u003c|im_start|\u003eassistant\nThe candidate with ID 12345 is currently in the \"Interview Scheduled\" stage for the position of Clinical Research Associate, with an interview date set for 2023-11-20.\u003c|im_end|\u003e\n```\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/LiquidAI/LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct#%F0%9F%8F%83-inference) 🏃 Inference\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLFM2.5 is supported by many inference frameworks.

Now I'm happy running local lol.\n\n**11t/s:**  \nsudo pkill -f llama-server; sudo nvidia-smi --gpu-reset -i 0,1,2,3 || true; sleep 5; sudo CUDA\\_VISIBLE\\_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 ./llama-server --model /home/llm/llama.cpp/models/gpt-oss-120b/Q4\\_K\\_M/gpt-oss-120b-Q4\\_K\\_M-00001-of-00002.gguf --n-gpu-layers 21 --main-gpu 0 --flash-attn off --cache-type-k q8\\_0 --cache-type-v f16 --ctx-size 30000 --port 8080 --host [0.0.0.0](http://0.0.0.0) \\--mmap --numa distribute --batch-size 384 --ubatch-size 256 --jinja --threads $(nproc) --parallel 2 --tensor-split 12,10,10,10 --mlock\n\n**21t/s**  \nsudo pkill -f llama-server; sudo nvidia-smi --gpu-reset -i 0,1,2,3 || true; sleep 5; sudo GGML\\_CUDA\\_ENABLE\\_UNIFIED\\_MEMORY=0 CUDA\\_VISIBLE\\_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 ./llama-server --model /home/llm/llama.cpp/models/gpt-oss-120b/Q4\\_K\\_M/gpt-oss-120b-Q4\\_K\\_M-00001-of-00002.gguf --n-gpu-layers 99 --main-gpu 0 --split-mode layer --tensor-split 5,5,6,20 -ot \"blk\\\\.(2\\[1-9\\]|\\[3-9\\]\\[0-9\\])\\\\.ffn\\_.\\*\\_exps\\\\.weight=CPU\" --ctx-size 30000 --port 8080 --host [0.0.0.0](http://0.0.0.0) \\--batch-size 512 --ubatch-size 256 --threads 8 --parallel 1 --mlock\n\nNothing here is worth copying and pasting as it is unique to my config but the moral of the story is, if you tune llama.cpp this thing will FLY!",

In commits 55d4206c8 and prior, the n_discard parameter is parsed directly from JSON input in the llama.cpp server's completion endpoints without validation to ensure it's non-negative. When a negative value is supplied and the context fills up, llama_memory_seq_rm/add receives a reversed range and negative offset, causing out-of-bounds memory writes in the token evaluation loop.

With 12B active parameters (52B total), it delivers precise question answering without the computational overhead of reasoning models. The model's SSM-Transformer architecture provides a memory-efficient solution for production agent stacks where consistent, grounded outputs are critical.\n\nReleased under Apache 2.0 License with a 256K context window, Jamba2 Mini is designed for enterprise workflows that demand accuracy and steerability. For more details, read the [full release blog post](https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/AI21-Jamba2-Mini/blob/main/ai21.com/blog/introducing-jamba2).\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/AI21-Jamba2-Mini#key-advantages) Key Advantages\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Superior reliability-to-throughput ratio:** Maintains high performance at 100K+ token contexts\n*   **Category-leading benchmarks:** Excels on IFBench, IFEval, Collie, and FACTS\n*   **Statistically significant quality wins:** Outperforms comparable models on real-world enterprise tasks\n*   **256K context window:** Processes technical manuals, research papers, and knowledge bases\n*   **Apache 2.0 License:** Fully open source for commercial use\n*   **Production-optimized:** Lean memory footprint for scalable deployments\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/AI21-Jamba2-Mini#evaluation-results) Evaluation Results\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJamba2 Mini leads on instruction following and grounding metrics, demonstrating exceptional steerability and context faithfulness. In blind side-by-side evaluations on 100 real-world enterprise prompts, the model achieved statistically significant wins on output quality and factuality compared to Ministral3 14B.\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/AI21-Jamba2-Mini#training-and-evaluation-details) Training and Evaluation Details\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJamba2 models were developed using a comprehensive post-training pipeline starting from Jamba 1.5 pre-training. The models underwent mid-training on 500B carefully curated tokens with increased representation of math, code, high-quality web data, and long documents. A state passing phase optimized the Mamba layers for effective context length generalization. Training continued with cold start supervised fine-tuning to establish instruction-following and reasoning capabilities, followed by DPO optimization.\n\nThe final training stages involved multiple on-policy reinforcement learning phases, progressively moving from short-context verifiable rewards to longer context training with mixed verifiable and model-based rewards. Evaluation focused on two key enterprise reliability signals: instruction-following benchmarks measuring steerability, and grounding benchmarks testing context faithfulness. Human evaluators assessed performance on real-world enterprise tasks using blind, counterbalanced side-by-side comparisons, rating outputs on factuality, style, constraint-adherence, instruction-following, and helpfulness.\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/AI21-Jamba2-Mini#quickstart) Quickstart\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/AI21-Jamba2-Mini#run-with-vllm) Run with vLLM\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBest results require vLLM version **0.12.0** or higher.\n\n```\nvllm serve \"ai21labs/AI21-Jamba2-Mini\" --mamba-ssm-cache-dtype float32 --enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser hermes --enable-prefix-caching --quantization experts_int8\n```\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/AI21-Jamba2-Mini#run-with-transformers) Run with Transformers\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n```\npip install transformers\u003e=4.54.0\npip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation\npip install causal-conv1d\u003e=1.2.0\npip install mamba-ssm\n```\n\n```\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"ai21labs/AI21-Jamba2-Mini\",\n                                  dtype=torch.bfloat16,\nattn_implementation=\"flash_attention_2\", device_map=\"auto\")\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"ai21labs/AI21-Jamba2-Mini\")\n\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"system\",\n     \"content\": \"You are an HR Policy Assistant.\n                 Answer employee questions using only the provided policy documents.\n                 If the answer isn't in the documents, say so clearly.\n                 Be concise and cite the specific policy section when possible.\"\n},\n    {\"role\": \"user\",\n     \"content\": \"Context documents: {retrieved_chunks}.\n                 Employee question: {user_question}.\n                 Answer:\"\n},\n]\n\nprompts = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=False)\n\noutputs = model.generate(**tokenizer(prompts, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device), do_sample=True, temperature=0.6)\n\ngenerated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\nprint(generated_text)\n```\n\nFor more deployment guides and resources, visit our [official documentation](https://docs.ai21.com/home).",

We are proud to release both under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), as part of our continued commitment to democratizing access to quality models. We are particularly excited this release includes a 3B model, enabling developers everywhere to download and run this technology right on their own devices, including iPhones, Androids, Macs, and PCs.\n\nJamba2 model family fast facts\n------------------------------\n\n*   License: [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n*   Model sizes: 3B (dense) 52B/12A\n*   Context window length: 256K\n*   Availability: [AI21 Studio](https://studio.ai21.com/v2/), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/ai21labs/jamba2)\n\nMaximum reliability and steerability\n------------------------------------\n\nWith over seven years of experience building AI systems for enterprise customers, we know that reliability and steerability are non-negotiables when it comes to choosing a model. 54% of enterprises still cite accuracy as the number one AI-related risk they are working to mitigate—with 30% of surveyed organizations having experienced the negative drawbacks of AI inaccuracies at least once ([McKinsey, 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai)). Even as models get increasingly sophisticated, there is an enormous, high-stakes gap to be filled when it comes to enterprise-grade accuracy.\n\nWe also know, from our work with customers, that not every enterprise workflow requires the high cost and high latency of reasoning models. Especially as more organizations adopt agents and model routers, a strong enterprise AI system should contain a range of model types, with different models called as needed based on task type and budget considerations.\n\nWith this in mind, we set out to build a model that delivers precise output with a lean memory footprint. To make “precision” measurable, we focused on two signals that map directly to real deployments: instruction-following benchmarks, which capture how steerable a model is, and grounding benchmarks, which test whether outputs stay faithful to the provided context. Together, they serve as practical indicators of how consistently a model will behave in enterprise knowledge workflows.\n\nToday, we’re bringing that vision to market with Jamba2: compact models that lead on these measures of enterprise reliability. Jamba2 is built to produce grounded answers across a range of source types, including technical manuals, research papers, company policies, and internal knowledge bases, so teams can deploy it as a dependable component in production stacks.\n\nLeader on instruction following and grounding\n---------------------------------------------\n\nJamba2 models excel across the instruction following benchmarks IFBench, IFEval, and Collie, as well as the grounding benchmark FACTS.\n\nWinning reliability-to-throughput ratio\n---------------------------------------\n\nFor the enterprise, models that shine on quality, yet choke in production-scale settings, are unusable.\n\nJamba2 leverages its memory-efficient architecture to maintain high throughput alongside high enterprise reliability, even as context scales to 100K tokens, mirroring the real-world usage we can expect from enterprise QA workflows.\n\nWinning performance on enterprise tasks\n---------------------------------------\n\nIn a human evaluated comparison between Jamba2 Mini and Ministral3 14B on a test set of real-world enterprise task prompts, Jamba2 Mini showed a statistically significant advantage in overall output quality and win rate. The tasks included a mix of enterprise QA tasks, instruction-heavy developer prompts, and other common business tasks such as summarization and drafting. This win rate encapsulates human preference, with special attention to factuality, style, constraint-adherence, instruction-following, and helpfulness.\n\n**Note on human evaluation methodology**: The models were evaluated by a team of content evaluation experts using a side-by-side, blind comparison protocol; left–right ordering was counterbalanced across items to mitigate order and precedence effects. Evaluators reviewed both outputs for both absolute metrics (general quality measures, as well as fine-grained error analysis), as well as human preference.\n\nHow we built it\n---------------\n\nTo train Jamba2, we utilized a contemporary LLM post-training pipeline. Following the pre-training phase, we mid-trained Jamba2 on 500B carefully curated tokens, with a higher representation of math and code in the mix, along with high-quality web data and long documents. We completed the mid-training phase with a short [state passing phase](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02782) for the model’s Mamba layers, a method recently introduced for effectively generalizing an SSM’s context length.\n\nGiven our midtrained model, we performed cold start SFT to teach the model basic instruction-following and reasoning. We then topped off the model with DPO to further improve its performance as a starting point for on-policy RL. Finally, we ran multiple on-policy RL phases on our model, starting with short-context verifiable rewards and gradually moving to longer context training with a mix of verifiable and model-based rewards.\n\nCarefully aggregating verifiable and model-based rewards was one of the key advancements allowing Jamba2 models to excel on tasks that require following specific instructions and details while adhering to the general intention of the user. As part of this process, we optimized our training infra for efficient on-policy RL training, which combines model inference in both the generation and reward phases of the training.\n\nGetting started with Jamba2\n---------------------------\n\nAvailable for download on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/ai21labs/jamba2) or directly on [AI21 Studio](https://studio.ai21.com/v2/), researchers and AI enthusiasts alike can enjoy experimenting with Jamba2 and pushing it to support new use cases—we can’t wait to see what you build!",

First, make sure to install vLLM (version 0.5.4 or higher is required):\n\n```\npip install vllm\u003e=0.6.5\n```\n\nJamba Large 1.7 is too large to be loaded in full (FP32) or half (FP16/BF16) precision on a single node of 8 80GB GPUs. Therefore, quantization is required. We've developed an innovative and efficient quantization technique, ExpertsInt8, designed for MoE models deployed in vLLM, including Jamba models. Using it, you'll be able to deploy Jamba Large 1.7 on a single node of 8 80GB GPUs. With ExpertsInt8 quantization and the default vLLM configuration, you'll be able to perform inference on prompts up to 220K tokens long on 8 80GB GPUs:\n\n```\nfrom vllm import LLM, SamplingParams\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel = \"ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-1.7-Large\"\n\nllm = LLM(model=model,\n          tensor_parallel_size=8,\n          max_model_len=220*1024,\n          quantization=\"experts_int8\",\n         )\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model)\n\nmessages = [\n   {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an ancient oracle who speaks in cryptic but wise phrases, always hinting at deeper meanings.\"},\n   {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello!\"},\n]\n\nprompts = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=False)\n\nsampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.4, top_p=0.95, max_tokens=100)\noutputs = llm.generate(prompts, sampling_params)\n\ngenerated_text = outputs[0].outputs[0].text\nprint(generated_text)\n```\n\n**Note:** Versions 4.44.0 and 4.44.1 of transformers have a bug that restricts the ability to run the Jamba architecture. Make sure you're not using these versions\n\n**Note:** If you're having trouble installing mamba-ssm and causal-conv1d for the optimized Mamba kernels, you can run Jamba Large 1.7 without them, at the cost of extra latency. In order to do that, add the kwarg use_mamba_kernels=False when loading the model via AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretained(). You can also find all instructions in our [private AI (vLLM) deployment guide](https://docs.ai21.com/docs/vllm).\n\n**Run the model with Transformers**\nTo load Jamba Large 1.7 in transformers on a single node of 8 80GB GPUs, we recommend to parallelize it using [accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index):\n\n```\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, BitsAndBytesConfig\n\nquantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_8bit=True,\n                                         llm_int8_skip_modules=[\"mamba\"])\n\n# a device map to distribute the model evenly across 8 GPUs\ndevice_map = {'model.embed_tokens': 0, 'model.layers.0': 0, 'model.layers.1': 0, 'model.layers.2': 0, 'model.layers.3': 0, 'model.layers.4': 0, 'model.layers.5': 0, 'model.layers.6': 0, 'model.layers.7': 0, 'model.layers.8': 0, 'model.layers.9': 1, 'model.layers.10': 1, 'model.layers.11': 1, 'model.layers.12': 1, 'model.layers.13': 1, 'model.layers.14': 1, 'model.layers.15': 1, 'model.layers.16': 1, 'model.layers.17': 1, 'model.layers.18': 2, 'model.layers.19': 2, 'model.layers.20': 2, 'model.layers.21': 2, 'model.layers.22': 2, 'model.layers.23': 2, 'model.layers.24': 2, 'model.layers.25': 2, 'model.layers.26': 2, 'model.layers.27': 3, 'model.layers.28': 3, 'model.layers.29': 3, 'model.layers.30': 3, 'model.layers.31': 3, 'model.layers.32': 3, 'model.layers.33': 3, 'model.layers.34': 3, 'model.layers.35': 3, 'model.layers.36': 4, 'model.layers.37': 4, 'model.layers.38': 4, 'model.layers.39': 4, 'model.layers.40': 4, 'model.layers.41': 4, 'model.layers.42': 4, 'model.layers.43': 4, 'model.layers.44': 4, 'model.layers.45': 5, 'model.layers.46': 5, 'model.layers.47': 5, 'model.layers.48': 5, 'model.layers.49': 5, 'model.layers.50': 5, 'model.layers.51': 5, 'model.layers.52': 5, 'model.layers.53': 5, 'model.layers.54': 6, 'model.layers.55': 6, 'model.layers.56': 6, 'model.layers.57': 6, 'model.layers.58': 6, 'model.layers.59': 6, 'model.layers.60': 6, 'model.layers.61': 6, 'model.layers.62': 6, 'model.layers.63': 7, 'model.layers.64': 7, 'model.layers.65': 7, 'model.layers.66': 7, 'model.layers.67': 7, 'model.layers.68': 7, 'model.layers.69': 7, 'model.layers.70': 7, 'model.layers.71': 7, 'model.final_layernorm': 7, 'lm_head': 7}\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-Large-1.7\",\n                                             torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n                                             attn_implementation=\"flash_attention_2\",\n                                             quantization_config=quantization_config,\n                                             device_map=device_map)\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-Large-1.7\")\n\nmessages = [\n   {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an ancient oracle who speaks in cryptic but wise phrases, always hinting at deeper meanings.\"},\n   {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello!\"},\n]\n\ninput_ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True, return_tensors='pt').to(model.device)\n\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids, max_new_tokens=216)\n\n# Decode the output\nconversation = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n\n# Split the conversation to get only the assistant's response\nassistant_response = conversation.split(messages[-1]['content'])[1].strip()\nprint(assistant_response)\n# Output: Seek and you shall find.

You can build vLLM from source if you wish to make use of them.\n\n**Run the model with Transformers**\nThe following example loads Jamba Mini 1.7 to the GPU in BF16 precision, uses optimized [FlashAttention2](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) and Mamba kernels, and parallelizes the model across multiple GPUs using [`accelerate`](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index).\n\n\u003e **Note:** In half precision (FP16/BF16), Jamba Mini 1.7 is too large to fit on a single 80GB GPU, so you'll need at least 2 such GPUs.\n\n```\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-1.7-Mini\",\n                                             torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n                                             attn_implementation=\"flash_attention_2\",\n                                             device_map=\"auto\")\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-1.7-Mini\")\n\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an ancient oracle who speaks in cryptic but wise phrases, always hinting at deeper meanings.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello!\"},\n]\n\nprompts = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=False)\n\nsampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.4, top_p=0.95, max_tokens=100)\noutputs = model.generate(**tokenizer(prompts, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device),\n                         **sampling_params.to_dict())\n\ngenerated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\nprint(generated_text)\n```\n\n\u003e **Note:** Versions `4.44.0` and `4.44.1` of `transformers` have a bug that restricts the ability to run the Jamba architecture. Make sure you're not using these versions.\n\n\u003e **Note:** If you're having trouble installing `mamba-ssm` and `causal-conv1d` for the optimized Mamba kernels, you can run Jamba Mini 1.7 without them at the cost of extra latency. To do that, add the kwarg `use_mamba_kernels=False` when loading the model:\n\n```\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-1.7-Mini\",\n                                             torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n                                             attn_implementation=\"flash_attention_2\",\n                                             device_map=\"auto\",\n                                             use_mamba_kernels=False)\n```\n\nYou can also find all instructions in our [private AI (vLLM) deployment guide](https://docs.ai21.com/docs/vllm).\n\nAnd to get started with our SDK:\n\n[AI21 Python SDK guide](https://docs.ai21.com/docs/sdk)\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-Mini-1.7#further-documentation) Further Documentation\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor comprehensive guides and advanced usage:\n\n*   [Tokenization Guide](https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tokenization) – Using `ai21-tokenizer`\n*   [Quantization Guide](https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quantization) – ExpertsInt8, bitsandbytes\n*   [Fine-tuning Guide](https://docs.ai21.com/docs/fine-tuning) – LoRA, qLoRA and full fine-tuning\n\n**For more resources to start building, visit our [official documentation](https://docs.ai21.com/docs).**\n\nDownloads last month 146 \n\nSafetensors\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/docs/safetensors)\n\nModel tree for ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-Mini-1.7[](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/model-cards#specifying-a-base-model)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCollection including ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-Mini-1.7\n-------------------------------------------------",

Mamba layers are more efficient for sequence processing, while attention layers capture complex dependencies. This mix reduces memory overhead, improves throughput, and makes the model run smoothly on laptops, GPUs, and even mobile devices, while maintainig impressive quality.\n\n**Smart: Leading intelligence scores** The model outperforms competitors, such as Gemma 3 4B, Llama 3.2 3B, and Granite 4.0 Micro, on a combined intelligence score that averages 6 standard benchmarks.\n\n**Scalable: Handles very long contexts**\n\nUnlike most compact models, Jamba Reasoning 3B supports extremely long contexts. Mamba layers allow the model to process inputs without storing massive attention caches, so it scales to **256K tokens** while keeping inference practical. This makes it suitable for edge deployment as well as datacenter workloads.\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-Reasoning-3B#model-details) Model Details\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Number of Parameters: 3B\n*   Number of Layers: 28 (26 Mamba, 2 Attention)\n*   Number of Attention Heads: 20 MQA (20 for Q, 1 for KV)\n*   Vocabulary Size: 64K\n*   Context Length: **256k**\n*   Architecture: Hybrid Transformer–Mamba with efficient attention and long-context support\n*   **Developed by:**[**AI21**](https://www.ai21.com/)\n*   **Supported languages:**English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, German, Arabic and Hebrew\n*   Intelligence benchmark results:\n\n|  | **MMLU-Pro** | **Humanity’s Last Exam** | **IFBench** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 1.5B | 27.0% | 3.3% | 13.0% |\n| Phi-4 mini | 47.0% | 4.2% | 21.0% |\n| Granite 4.0 Micro | 44.7% | 5.1% | 24.8% |\n| Llama 3.2 3B | 35.0% | 5.2% | 26.0% |\n| Gemma 3 4B | 42.0% | 5.2% | 28.0% |\n| Qwen 3 1.7B | 57.0% | 4.8% | 27.0% |\n| Qwen 3 4B | 70% | 5.1% | 33% |\n| **Jamba Reasoning 3B** | **61.0%** | **6.0%** | **52.0%** |\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-Reasoning-3B#quickstart) Quickstart\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-Reasoning-3B#run-the-model-locally) Run the model locally\n\n\u003e Please reference the GGUF model card [here](https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-Reasoning-3B-GGUF#quickstart).\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-Reasoning-3B#run-the-model-with-vllm)**Run the model with vLLM**\n\nFor best results, we recommend using vLLM version 0.11.0 or higher and enabling `--mamba-ssm-cache-dtype=float32`\n\n```\npip install vllm\u003e=0.11.0\n```\n\nUsing vllm in online server mode:\n\n```\nvllm serve \"ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-Reasoning-3B\" --mamba-ssm-cache-dtype float32 --reasoning-parser deepseek_r1 --enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser hermes\n```\n\nUsing vllm in offline mode:\n\n```\nfrom vllm import LLM, SamplingParams\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel = \"ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-Reasoning-3B\"\n\nllm = LLM(model=model,\n          tensor_parallel_size=1,\n          mamba_ssm_cache_dtype=\"float32\")\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model)\n\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"You are analyzing customer support tickets to decide which need escalation.\\nTicket 1: 'App crashes when uploading files \u003e50MB.'\\nTicket 2: 'Forgot password, can’t log in.'\\nTicket 3: 'Billing page missing enterprise pricing.'\\nClassify each ticket as Critical, Medium, or Low and explain your reasoning.\\n\"},\n]\n\nprompts = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=False)\n\nsampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.6, max_tokens=4096)\noutputs = llm.generate(prompts, sampling_params)\n\ngenerated_text = outputs[0].outputs[0].text\nprint(generated_text)\n```\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-Reasoning-3B#run-the-model-with-transformers)**Run the model with Transformers**\n\n```\npip install transformers\u003e= 4.54.0\npip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation\npip install causal-conv1d\u003e=1.2.0\npip install mamba-ssm\n```\n\n```\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-Reasoning-3B\",\n                                             dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n                                             attn_implementation=\"flash_attention_2\",\n                                             device_map=\"auto\")\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-Reasoning-3B\")\n\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"You are analyzing customer support tickets to decide which need escalation.\\nTicket 1: 'App crashes when uploading files \u003e50MB.'\\nTicket 2: 'Forgot password, can’t log in.'\\nTicket 3: 'Billing page missing enterprise pricing.'\\nClassify each ticket as Critical, Medium, or Low and explain your reasoning.\\n\"},\n]\n\nprompts = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=False)\n\noutputs = model.generate(**tokenizer(prompts, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device), do_sample=True, temperature=0.6, max_new_tokens=4096)\n\ngenerated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\nprint(generated_text)\n```\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-Reasoning-3B#training-details) Training Details\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe trained the model in multiple stages, each designed to strengthen reasoning and long-context performance. The process began with large-scale pre-training on a diverse corpus of natural documents. We then mid-trained on ~0.5T tokens of math and code, while extending the context length to 32K tokens. During this stage we also applied a [Mamba-specific long-context method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02782), which we found to significantly improve long-context abilities.\n\nTo improve reasoning, tool use, and instruction following, we applied cold-start distillation: supervised fine-tuning with a 32K window and direct preference optimization with a 64K window. Finally, we enhanced reasoning performance further through online reinforcement learning with RLVR, targeting tasks such as code generation, mathematical problem solving, structured output, and information extraction.\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-Reasoning-3B#reinforcement-fine-tuning) Reinforcement “Fine-Tuning”\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFull support for training Jamba through VeRL will be available soon. AI21 has introduced several improvements to the VeRL framework ([https://github.com/volcengine/verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl)), including new capabilities for training hybrid models, and stability improvements for GRPO training. These improvements will soon be available to the open source community.\n\n* * *\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-Reasoning-3B#license) License\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   `Apache 2.0`\n\n* * *\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-Reasoning-3B#citation) Citation\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Blog post- Read the full blog post [here](https://www.ai21.com/blog/introducing-jamba-reasoning-3B)",

I tried with the latest ik\\_llama.cpp from git. But it sounds like you managed to get these options working?\n\nAs of your bottleneck, for token generation I think it is both your CPU and RAM. During token generation, all 64 cores on my EPYC 7763 get saturated a little bit sooner than memory bandwidth of 8-channel 3200MHz RAM, so any slower CPU would reduce the performance. This also means your rig is well balanced, faster memory would probably not make much difference, so your current memory is well suited for your CPU. 4 tokens/s is very good given your CPU and RAM speeds, probably GPUs help a lot.\n\nBut your prompt processing speed is unusually slow, you should be getting about the same speed as me (around 200 tokens/s) since prompt processing is done on GPUs and my CPU is almost idle while it happens. I see you have `--n-cpu-moe 68` \\- I did not try it myself, but very likely it is not equivalent to the proper `-ot` options. Calibrating `--tensor-split` and `-ot` lines to decide how many layers to put and where can be time consuming but I think it is necessary if you want to get the best performance. Notice how I have `exps=CPU` at the end - order is important. And you can manually write layers number from 3 and up in each `-ot` line, to define which layers go to which CUDA device - in my case I put 4 on my first GPU (CUDA0) and 5 layers on the rest, but depending on your VRAM usage by the system and other factors, you may need to change my example.",

The trick is to load with the override tensor flag as many layers as you can on the video cards without compromising too much with context. \n\nI'd suggest against quantizing the cache to even 8 bit as it brings spelling errors and slight hallucinations, it's tolerable for general conversation, not for coding or anything income related. \n\nAlso for ik_llama.cpp use Ubergarm's quants https://huggingface.co/ubergarm/GLM-4.7-GGUF or Thireus's, they are optimized for ik_llama.cpp and should give faster results. Ubergarm has an excellent readme with every trick to squeeze out performances.\n\nHow many ram sticks do you have? That epyc has an 8ch memory controller, if you have all the dimm slots occupied the ram bandwidth should be around double mine. I'd suggest measuring it with Intel MLC or a similar tool. Nevermind, read the comment about the processor having 2 ccds. So yeah, It's probably bottlenecking. I'd still try to squeeze out some more numbers.\n\nPersonally --n-cpu-moe never worked for me and gave sluggish speed, the -ot approach worked better, so I'd try that one. I'd also choose the smallest Q4 quant over the K_M one. Power limiting should not be an issue, you can monitor it with nvtop anyway to check if the gpus cap it.",

You'll save a lot of power, and end up with better performance.\n\nJokes aside, two things are killing your performance: that CPU and your RAM speed (you don't say how many sticks you have, so there's also a chance your memory configuration is bad if you have 4x64GB sticks).\n\nEpyc Rome and Milan have ~26GB/s bandwidth between each CCD and the IO die. To get maximum memory bandwidth, you need a CPU with 8 CCDs. Given the compute, 32 cores might not cut it, so you need either 48 or 64 cores to crunch those numbers. The IO die has 8 memory channels, each running at a maximum speed of 3200MT/s. You're running at 2133, which would be bad, if it wasn't for your CPU having 2 CCDs only cutting it's effective bandwidth by four.\n\nKnow thy hardware before buying parts and putting a system together. It's a bit of a moot point now that you have it, and with current RAM prices you'll probably need a kidney to upgrade to 3200 memory.

      "content": "Hey all! I'm sharing an updated version of my MCTS-for-conversations project. Instead of generating single responses, it explores entire conversation trees to find dialogue strategies and prunes bad paths. I built it to help get better research directions for projects, but it can be used for anything\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/shr3e0liv1cg1.png?width=2560\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=eec800c6dcd9f1a4fd033d003fe80e102cba8079\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS](https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS)\n\nMotivation: I like MCTS :3 and I originally wanted to make this a dataset-creation agent, but this is what it evolved into on its own. Basically:DTS runs parallel beam search over conversation branches. You give it a goal and opening message, and it:\n\n(Note: this isnt mcts. It's parallel beam search. UCB1 is too wild with llms for me)\n\n1. Generates N diverse strategies\n2. Forks each into user intent variants - skeptical, cooperative, confused, resistant (if enabled, or defaults to engaged + probing)\n3. Rolls out full multi-turn conversations down each branch\n4. Has 3 independent LLM judges score each trajectory, takes the median\n5. Prunes branches below threshold, backpropagates scores\n6. Repeats for however many rounds you configure\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zkii0idvv1cg1.png?width=762\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=905f9787a8b7c7bfafcc599e95a3b73005c331b4\n\nThree judges with median voting helps a lot with the LLM-as-judge variance problem from CAE. Still not grounded in anything real, but outlier scores get filtered. Research context helps but the scroing is still stochastic. I tried a rubric based approach but it was trash.\n\nMain additions over CAE:\n\n* user intent forking (strategies get stress-tested against different personas)\n* deep research integration via GPT-Researcher for domain context\n* proper visualization with conversation playback\n\nOnly supports openai compatible endpoints atm - works with whatever models you have access to there. It's token-hungry though, a full run can hit 300+ LLM calls depending on config. If running locally, disable parallel calls\n\nIt's open source (Apache 2.0) and I'm happy to take contributions if anyone wants to help out. Just a project.\n\n\\--\n\nBTW: Backend was done mostly by me as the planner/sys designer, etc + Claude Code for implementation/refactoring. Frontend was purely vibe coded. Sorry if the code is trash.",

This leads to:\n\n*   **Myopic responses** that sound good but lead to dead ends\n*   **Single-path thinking** that misses better strategic approaches\n*   **Fragile strategies** that fail when users respond unexpectedly\n\nDTS solves this by treating conversation as a **tree search problem**:\n\n1.   **Explore multiple strategies** in parallel (not just one response)\n2.   **Simulate diverse user reactions** (skeptical, enthusiastic, confused, etc.)\n3.   **Score complete trajectories** against your goal\n4.   **Prune bad paths early** to focus computation on promising directions\n\nThe result: dialogue strategies that are **robust**, **goal-oriented**, and **tested against varied user behaviors**.\n\n* * *\n\nHow It Works\n------------\n\n[](https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS#how-it-works)\n### The Algorithm\n\n[](https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS#the-algorithm)\nDTS implements a parallel beam search with the following loop:\n\n```\nFor each round:\n    1. Generate N diverse conversation strategies\n    2. For each strategy, simulate K user intent variants\n    3. Roll out multi-turn conversations for each branch\n    4. Score all trajectories with 3 independent judges\n    5. Prune branches below threshold (median vote)\n    6. Backpropagate scores up the tree\n    7. Repeat with surviving branches\n```\n\n### Parallel Beam Search\n\n[](https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS#parallel-beam-search)\nUnlike traditional single-path generation, DTS maintains multiple conversation branches simultaneously:\n\nLoading\n\ngraph TD\n    subgraph Round 1\n        Root[User Message] --\u003e S1[Strategy: Empathetic]\n        Root --\u003e S2[Strategy: Direct]\n        Root --\u003e S3[Strategy: Socratic]\n    end\n\n    subgraph Round 2\n        S1 --\u003e S1I1[Intent: Cooperative]\n        S1 --\u003e S1I2[Intent: Skeptical]\n        S2 --\u003e S2I1[Intent: Cooperative]\n        S2 --\u003e S2I2[Intent: Resistant]\n    end\n\n    subgraph Scoring\n        S1I1 --\u003e J1((Judge 1))\n        S1I1 --\u003e J2((Judge 2))\n        S1I1 --\u003e J3((Judge 3))\n        J1 \u0026 J2 \u0026 J3 --\u003e M{Median Vote}\n    end\n\n    M --\u003e|Score ≥ 6.5| Keep[Keep Branch]\n    M --\u003e|Score \u003c 6.5| Prune[Prune Branch]\n\n[](https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS/blob/main/media/just_tree_ss.png)_Branches are color-coded by score: green (passing), yellow (borderline), red (pruned)_\n\n**Key parameters:**\n\n*   `init_branches`: Number of initial strategies (default: 6)\n*   `turns_per_branch`: Conversation depth per branch (default: 5)\n*   `max_concurrency`: Parallel LLM calls (default: 16)\n\n### User Intent Forking (Optional)\n\n[](https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS#user-intent-forking-optional)\nMost dialogue systems assume a single \"happy path\" user response. DTS can stress-test strategies against **diverse user personas** when enabled.\n\n**User Variability Mode:**\n\n*   `user_variability=False` (default): Uses a fixed \"healthily critical + engaged\" persona for consistent, realistic testing\n*   `user_variability=True`: Generates diverse user intents for robustness testing across user types\n\nWhen variability is enabled, possible user personas include:\n\n| Emotional Tone | Cognitive Stance | Example Behavior |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `engaged` | `accepting` | Cooperative, follows suggestions |\n| `skeptical` | `questioning` | Asks for evidence, challenges claims |\n| `confused` | `exploring` | Needs clarification, misunderstands |\n| `resistant` | `challenging` | Pushes back, disagrees |\n| `anxious` | `withdrawing` | Hesitant, wants to end conversation |\n\nEach strategy can fork into K intent variants (configurable via `user_intents_per_branch`), creating branches that prove robustness across user types.\n\n**UserIntent structure:**\n\nUserIntent(\n    id=\"skeptical_questioner\",\n    label=\"Skeptical Questioner\",\n    description=\"Demands evidence before accepting claims\",\n    emotional_tone=\"skeptical\",      # How user feels\n    cognitive_stance=\"questioning\",  # How user thinks\n)\n\n### Multi-Judge Scoring\n\n[](https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS#multi-judge-scoring)\nEach trajectory is evaluated by **3 independent LLM judges**. Scores are aggregated via **median voting** (robust to outlier judges):\n\n```\nJudge 1: 7.2  ─┐\nJudge 2: 6.8  ─┼─► Median: 7.2  ─► Pass (≥ 6.5)\nJudge 3: 8.1  ─┘\n```\n\n**Why 3 judges?**\n\n*   Single judge = high variance, easily gamed\n*   Median of 3 = robust to one outlier\n*   Majority vote determines pass/fail (2 of 3 must pass)\n\n**Scoring criteria** (each 0-1, summed to 0-10):\n\n*   Goal achievement\n*   User need addressed\n*   Forward progress\n*   Clarity \u0026 coherence\n*   Appropriate tone\n*   Information accuracy\n*   Handling objections\n*   Building rapport\n*   Conversation flow\n*   Strategic effectiveness\n\n**High-Scoring Branch (9.2/10)**\n\n[](https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS/blob/main/media/selected_branch_ss.png)**Pruned Branch (4.1/10)**\n\n[](https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS/blob/main/media/pruned_branch_ss.png)\n\n_Left: A successful trajectory with detailed strengths. Right: A pruned branch showing weaknesses and why it failed._\n\n### Scoring Modes: Comparative vs Absolute\n\n[](https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS#scoring-modes-comparative-vs-absolute)\n[](https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS/blob/main/media/scoring_ss.png)\n\nDTS supports two evaluation modes:\n\n| Mode | How It Works | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Comparative** | Sibling branches force-ranked against each other | Sharp discrimination, finding the single best path |\n| **Absolute** | Each branch scored independently (0-10) | Early pruning, filtering obviously bad paths |\n\n**Comparative mode** (default):\n\n```\nInput: [Strategy A, Strategy B, Strategy C] (siblings)\nOutput: A=7.5, B=6.0, C=4.5 (forced ranking with 1.5-point gaps)\n```\n\n**Absolute mode**:\n\n```\nInput: Strategy A (evaluated alone)\nOutput: 3 judges → [7.2, 6.8, 8.1] → Median: 7.2\n```\n\nUse `scoring_mode=\"comparative\"` when you need the best single answer. Use `scoring_mode=\"absolute\"` when filtering many branches quickly.\n\n* * *\n\nSystem Architecture\n-------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS#system-architecture)\n\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant FE as Frontend (HTML/JS)\n    participant API as FastAPI WebSocket\n    participant ENG as DTS Engine\n    participant LLM as OpenRouter/OpenAI\n    participant RES as Firecrawl + Tavily\n\n    User-\u003e\u003eFE: Configure \u0026 Start Search\n    FE-\u003e\u003eAPI: WebSocket Connect\n    API-\u003e\u003eENG: Initialize DTSEngine\n\n    opt Deep Research Enabled\n        ENG-\u003e\u003eRES: Research Query\n        RES--\u003e\u003eENG: Domain Context\n    end\n\n    loop For Each Round\n        ENG-\u003e\u003eLLM: Generate Strategies\n        LLM--\u003e\u003eENG: N Strategies\n\n        loop For Each Branch\n            ENG-\u003e\u003eLLM: Generate User Intents\n            ENG-\u003e\u003eLLM: Simulate Conversation\n            ENG-\u003e\u003eLLM: Judge Trajectory (3x)\n        end\n\n        ENG-\u003e\u003eAPI: Emit Events (node_added, scored, pruned)\n        API--\u003e\u003eFE: Stream Updates\n        FE-\u003e\u003eUser: Update Visualization\n    end\n\n    ENG-\u003e\u003eAPI: Complete with Best Path\n    FE-\u003e\u003eUser: Show Results\n\n### Component Overview\n\n[](https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS#component-overview)\n| Component | Location | Purpose |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **DTSEngine** | `backend/core/dts/engine.py` | Main orchestrator, runs expand→score→prune loop |\n| **StrategyGenerator** | `backend/core/dts/components/generator.py` | Creates strategies and user intents |\n| **ConversationSimulator** | `backend/core/dts/components/simulator.py` | Runs multi-turn dialogue rollouts |\n| **TrajectoryEvaluator** | `backend/core/dts/components/evaluator.py` | Multi-judge scoring with median aggregation |\n| **DeepResearcher** | `backend/core/dts/components/researcher.py` | GPT-Researcher integration for context |\n| **DialogueTree** | `backend/core/dts/tree.py` | Tree data structure with backpropagation |\n| **LLM Client** | `backend/llm/client.py` | Provider-agnostic OpenAI-compatible wrapper |\n\n* * *\n\nPrerequisites \u0026 API Keys\n------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS#prerequisites--api-keys)\n### Required Credentials\n\n[](https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS#required-credentials)\n| Service | Environment Variable | Required | Purpose |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **LLM Provider** | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | **Yes** | Strategy generation, simulation, and judging |\n| **Web Scraping** | `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` | For Deep Research | Scrapes web pages for research context |\n| **Web Search** | `TAVILY_API_KEY` | For Deep Research | Searches the web for relevant sources |\n\n### Getting API Keys\n\n[](https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS#getting-api-keys)\n1.   **OpenRouter** (recommended): [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)\n\n    *   Works with 100+ models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, open-source)\n    *   Pay-per-token, no subscriptions\n    *   Set `OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`\n\n2.   **Firecrawl**: [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev/)\n\n    *   Required for `deep_research=True`\n    *   Handles JavaScript-rendered pages, anti-bot bypass\n\n3.   **Tavily**: [tavily.com](https://tavily.com/)\n\n    *   Required for `deep_research=True`\n    *   AI-optimized web search API\n\n\u003e **Note:** Deep Research features require both Firecrawl and Tavily keys.

We are proud to release both under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), as part of our continued commitment to democratizing access to quality models. We are particularly excited this release includes a 3B model, enabling developers everywhere to download and run this technology right on their own devices, including iPhones, Androids, Macs, and PCs.\n\nJamba2 model family fast facts\n------------------------------\n\n*   License: [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n*   Model sizes: 3B (dense) 52B/12A\n*   Context window length: 256K\n*   Availability: [AI21 Studio](https://studio.ai21.com/v2/), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/ai21labs/jamba2)\n\nMaximum reliability and steerability\n------------------------------------\n\nWith over seven years of experience building AI systems for enterprise customers, we know that reliability and steerability are non-negotiables when it comes to choosing a model. 54% of enterprises still cite accuracy as the number one AI-related risk they are working to mitigate—with 30% of surveyed organizations having experienced the negative drawbacks of AI inaccuracies at least once ([McKinsey, 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai)). Even as models get increasingly sophisticated, there is an enormous, high-stakes gap to be filled when it comes to enterprise-grade accuracy.\n\nWe also know, from our work with customers, that not every enterprise workflow requires the high cost and high latency of reasoning models. Especially as more organizations adopt agents and model routers, a strong enterprise AI system should contain a range of model types, with different models called as needed based on task type and budget considerations.\n\nWith this in mind, we set out to build a model that delivers precise output with a lean memory footprint. To make “precision” measurable, we focused on two signals that map directly to real deployments: instruction-following benchmarks, which capture how steerable a model is, and grounding benchmarks, which test whether outputs stay faithful to the provided context. Together, they serve as practical indicators of how consistently a model will behave in enterprise knowledge workflows.\n\nToday, we’re bringing that vision to market with Jamba2: compact models that lead on these measures of enterprise reliability. Jamba2 is built to produce grounded answers across a range of source types, including technical manuals, research papers, company policies, and internal knowledge bases, so teams can deploy it as a dependable component in production stacks.\n\nLeader on instruction following and grounding\n---------------------------------------------\n\nJamba2 models excel across the instruction following benchmarks IFBench, IFEval, and Collie, as well as the grounding benchmark FACTS.\n\nWinning reliability-to-throughput ratio\n---------------------------------------\n\nFor the enterprise, models that shine on quality, yet choke in production-scale settings, are unusable.\n\nJamba2 leverages its memory-efficient architecture to maintain high throughput alongside high enterprise reliability, even as context scales to 100K tokens, mirroring the real-world usage we can expect from enterprise QA workflows.\n\nWinning performance on enterprise tasks\n---------------------------------------\n\nIn a human evaluated comparison between Jamba2 Mini and Ministral3 14B on a test set of real-world enterprise task prompts, Jamba2 Mini showed a statistically significant advantage in overall output quality and win rate. The tasks included a mix of enterprise QA tasks, instruction-heavy developer prompts, and other common business tasks such as summarization and drafting. This win rate encapsulates human preference, with special attention to factuality, style, constraint-adherence, instruction-following, and helpfulness.\n\n**Note on human evaluation methodology**: The models were evaluated by a team of content evaluation experts using a side-by-side, blind comparison protocol; left–right ordering was counterbalanced across items to mitigate order and precedence effects. Evaluators reviewed both outputs for both absolute metrics (general quality measures, as well as fine-grained error analysis), as well as human preference.\n\nHow we built it\n---------------\n\nTo train Jamba2, we utilized a contemporary LLM post-training pipeline. Following the pre-training phase, we mid-trained Jamba2 on 500B carefully curated tokens, with a higher representation of math and code in the mix, along with high-quality web data and long documents. We completed the mid-training phase with a short [state passing phase](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02782) for the model’s Mamba layers, a method recently introduced for effectively generalizing an SSM’s context length.\n\nGiven our midtrained model, we performed cold start SFT to teach the model basic instruction-following and reasoning. We then topped off the model with DPO to further improve its performance as a starting point for on-policy RL. Finally, we ran multiple on-policy RL phases on our model, starting with short-context verifiable rewards and gradually moving to longer context training with a mix of verifiable and model-based rewards.\n\nCarefully aggregating verifiable and model-based rewards was one of the key advancements allowing Jamba2 models to excel on tasks that require following specific instructions and details while adhering to the general intention of the user. As part of this process, we optimized our training infra for efficient on-policy RL training, which combines model inference in both the generation and reward phases of the training.\n\nGetting started with Jamba2\n---------------------------\n\nAvailable for download on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/ai21labs/jamba2) or directly on [AI21 Studio](https://studio.ai21.com/v2/), researchers and AI enthusiasts alike can enjoy experimenting with Jamba2 and pushing it to support new use cases—we can’t wait to see what you build!",

Just the bottleneck moves from me producing code (which is already lesser part of my job comparing to thinking about high-level structures. So it is kinda not a bottleneck anyway, just a nice spot to optimize) to me reviewing code.\n\nBefore that it was problematic too. Just we did not achieve the stage when this become bottleneck (means earlier bottlenecks is partially solved).\n\nAnd no, no way that electronic fucker (or human. My own, lol - better to at least review your own code later, when your stream of thoughts changed enough so you have a chance to see things from different angle) output get past me before I am sure I understand what this thing is doing.\n\n\\\u0026gt; **reviewing code is harder than writing it**\n\nHe is exactly right.\n\nIf you don't do it in digestable chunks.\n\nAnd for chunks to be digestable you have to know what to expect. So you have to take part in planning structural stuff. Either all by yourself or combo of you + LLM agent (it may give boost here too, by reviewing your ideas for missing corner cases or even noticing utterly wrong understanding of some stuff; also by suggesting tweaks). So this way you kinda know what to expect here.\n\nSo if you want to vibecode the whole thing and only review in the end - no, probably not the way unless coding agents get not only good quality, but actually superhuman quality. And even than - they would not be perfect decision mechanisms, so stacking them and human devs would still make sense. Because as soon as we make and notice different kind of errors - stacking different weak mechanisms would still work.\n\nIf you think about it like about pair programming, on the other hand - just a \"pair\" being not a human, but machine - it may start making sense,",

The compiler / runtime errors will help improve quality and catch bugs, vs interpreted languages where it's only runtime..

Start simple, and scale up.  EG: extract any s3 buckets and check that they have encryption + auth turned on is a  classic example for low hanging fruit.  TLDR: how do you validate that the code is right? validate it by testing.\n\n\\#3: Have the code checked in in small steps, so if there is a problem rollback is easy.

          "content": "Your CTO is totally right, and the problem he describes predates LLM codegen.  The advent of codegen has exacerbated problem tremendously, is all.\n\nPart of the problem in places I've worked is that management controls how much of developers' time is spend writing new code vs paying off technical debt, and management does not allocate enough time to paying off that debt.\n\nIn that sense, it is a people-problem, not a technical problem.  Fix management and the problem becomes a lot more tractable.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some things you can do to make LLM-inferred projects faster/easier to validate and review:\n\n**Write comprehensive unit tests**\n\nPreferably have the humans do this before codegen, because ideally unit tests will describe how code is expected to behave, which will help LLMs infer the expected code.  Not many devs like to write unit tests, though, so having your LLM generate unit tests after the fact is a second-best solution.  Note that you will need to instruct the LLM to write \"testable\" code, because sometimes the most natural-seeming implementations are not easily unit-tested.\n\nUnit tests with mocked dependencies are beneficial because they exercise the different parts of your project in isolation and verify that their outputs/side-effects comply with expectations.  This means you can find many bugs simply by running your unit tests, and which unit tests fail point you precisely at the code which needs to be fixed (if your tests are high-enough granularity, which requires that your functions/methods are decomposed into subroutines.  This is an important aspect of writing code to be testable).\n\nIt also makes adjusting the behavior of the project to comply with expectations easier, if you find that code does not do what you want it to do.  You can tweak the appropriate unit test(s), or write new tests, and have the dev or LLM fix the code so that the test passes.\n\nIt is good industry practice to make sure a development branch passes all unit tests before merging it into the main branch, and then making sure the merge passes all unit tests before pushing it to the remote repo.\n\n**Write good documentation**\n\nOne of the best uses I've found for codegen LLMs is to have them explain my coworkers' code to me.  Most codegen models (and some non-codegen models!) are good at writing code documentation.  This helps me come up to speed not just for code reviews but also for contributing to legacy projects with which I am familiar.\n\nIdeally you should have at least two layers of documentation, preferably three:\n\n* A high-level view, which is short and easy to read, explaining the purpose of the project, who is expected to use it, and for what, and the general flow of data through the project -- its inputs, its outputs, its side-effects, and the components it passes through in-between.\n\n* A component-level view, which describes the main subsystems involved in the project and their interfaces.  These can be libraries, external dependencies like databases or service APIs, frameworks, or any other reasonable-seeming partitioning of the project into a small handful of parts.  If you omit any documentation, it would be this one, not the high- or low-level views.\n\n* A low-level view, usually by source code file, which describes what the code in the file is for, what its classes and any global state are, the methods used by those classes, and what other files use those classes and/or call those methods.\n\nGood documentation will get the human reviewers up to speed quickly and let them start and finish their reviews more quickly.\n\n**Generate a list of possible bugs/problems**\n\nYou don't want to totally automate the code review process, but there's nothing wrong with asking the LLM to infer a list of what might be bugs or weaknesses in the project, for the human reviewers to assess.  When I ask GLM-4.5-Air to enumerate problems in my code, usually only about a third of the problems it identifies are actual problems which need fixing, but it's still better to have it than not.\n\nThis can help focus code reviewers' attention and at least give them something to consider, regarding whether the project should be better than it is.\n\n**Use a structured log**\n\nA lot of problems only become visible once you've been using a project for a while for real-world tasks.  A structured log will not only help you spot problems, but also expose the program's internal state in the steps leading up to the problem.  This is invaluable for rapid troubleshooting.\n\nWhen a problem crops up, you can look back through the log to identify exactly where things went awry, and use the conditions represented in the log to inform bugfixes and (especially!) new unit tests which would have identified the problem before it was put into production.\n\nStrictly speaking this is slightly out of scope for your problem, as the structured log only becomes useful *after* the code passes review and is put into production, but the simple fact is that not all problems get caught in code review.  Realistically new code needs to be vetted both before and after deployment.\n\n\n**These measures will accelerate code review, but the underlying problem persists.**\n\nIncorporating all of these measures can shorten the time it takes to review a project, but human reviewers still have to put in the work to verify that the code is good.  Depending on how many reviewers you have and how much code you are generating, they might or might not be able to keep up.\n\nWhether to bottleneck deployment of new code on code review, and how much, is and always has been a trade-off determined by the development team's management.  It is their job to assess the tradeoffs between releasing thoroughly-vetted code versus releasing possibly-buggy code and adding to the employer's technical debt.\n\nGenerating new code via LLM inference doesn't change that, but you should be able to demonstrate mathematically that given fixed human dev resources (say, programmer-hours per month, allocated to developing new code vs code reviews vs paying down technical debt), and given a fixed management tolerance for accumulating technical debt, the total useful code deployed per unit time is increased when LLMs generate at least some of the new code.",

It's a matter of doing the maths of which side you manage for what the product goals and roadmap is.  A pipe can only hold so much volume.  Right now you have pressure on the input side and it's more like a storm water drain than a filtered water outlet.  To strain the storm water you need a bigger pipe and grate which lets more things through.\n\nIt's up to the dev to ensure they are submitting quality pull requests.  If a PR comes in a human doesn't understand it then they have failed at their job.  If a reviewer finds a problem, it doesn't matter where it came from, that dev put in the PR - PRs have problems that's why we have them but to put one in that had no attempt to find the problems and submit understandable quality is egregious and if agents are writing code faster than the gates can handle then that's what's happening.\n\nPerformance objectives need to be updated to include appropriate use of AI. Everyone needs to be on the same page about what matters to your product, if some members of your team want to move faster than humans can understand and others want more thorough reviews then you have a culture problem that needs to be addressed.\n\nI mostly use AI for weird problems where I don't know where to start, like chunks of code I haven't touched before, then I take over and try to solve it myself where I can.  I use it to check the work I did for anything I missed, and you need to be careful with that too it can dream things so you need to know what you know to assess it. I also use it for bulk changes where it has a sample to go off for style and patterns.\n\nThe other day I had to put in a change that I didn't understand.  It was a legacy product in a framework I don't know and from top down they said they urgently need it and they are OK with AI writing it.  I reviewed it as best I could but I had no idea why it worked and in the PR I clearly stated that it was mostly AI written and I didn't fully understand how it works.  I'm a consultant and told them it's a bad idea, the owners said they wanted it, ok sure the people paying the bills get what they want.",

Data-driven insights from real developer evaluations, not marketing hype.\n\nHow Rankings Work\n-----------------\n\n### Judge Score (Primary Metric)\n\nEach model output is scored by 3 frontier AI judges (Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro). We take the median score to reduce individual judge bias. Scores are based on 5 weighted criteria: Correctness (35%), Security (20%), Code Quality (20%), Efficiency (15%), and Completeness (10%).\n\n### Community Vote\n\nDevelopers vote on model outputs in blind head-to-head comparisons. Win rate shows the percentage of matchups where this model was chosen. Every vote requires a comment explaining the reasoning.\n\n### Response Time\n\nThe mean time each model takes to generate a response. Faster isn't always better—some models trade speed for quality—but this helps you understand performance trade-offs.\n\n### Cost per Evaluation\n\nAverage API cost for each model based on actual token usage. Pricing data sourced from OpenRouter. Helps you balance quality against budget.\n\n### Aggregation\n\nRankings aggregate all public evaluations. Same prompt from different users contributes to the same benchmark. This builds a community-driven dataset that reflects real-world usage, not synthetic benchmarks.\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nTraditional benchmarks like HumanEval and SWE-Bench use synthetic tasks that don't reflect real-world usage. CodeLens rankings are built on actual code challenges from real developers, making it a more accurate benchmark for choosing which AI model to use for your specific needs.\n\n[Read our full methodology](https://codelens.ai/methodology)\n\n### Contribute to the Leaderboard\n\nRun evaluations on your own prompts and help build the most accurate AI model benchmark. Pro users' results contribute to these public rankings.",

Do your own researches and always understand what you do when it's related to safety.\n2.   Draw an electrical plan of your home (avoid trusting existing plan, especially for old building) and check the maximum amperage/voltage allowed per circuit / power strip / smart plug.\n3.   Always check the specs of the PSU you want to buy to see max wattage per cable (usually but not always: SATA ~54W, Molex ~132W, 6pin ~75W, 8pin ~150W per cable). The 'per cable' is important because it means that if you have 1 cable with 2 _8pin at the end, it's actually 75W per 8pin in this case. For example, if you have a PSU saying that it has 8_(2 _8pin), it's in total 16 8pin but you can only power 4 MI50 (having each 2_ 8pin and requiring 300W per card). /!\\ Even if you cap the power draw of you card to 150W, this is not advised to plug only 1 cable of 2 _8pin; this is better to have 2 cables of 2_ 8pin per MI50, and for the remaining 8pin, it can be used for the extender (if 6+2pin).\n4.   Don't forget that your PSU needs also the right number of SATA/molex/6pin for PWM HUB, add2psu and extenders (extenders with molex or 6 pin are better than sata as they usually required more power to be steady)\n5.   The fan port of your motherboard usually supports ~1A so don't plug too many fans (having more than 1A in total) on it, if you don't want to burn your motherboard (or more). That's why PWM HUB FAN is often required for this kind of setup as the motherboard does not have enough fan ports.\n\nSoftware details\n----------------\n\n[](https://github.com/ai-infos/guidances-setup-16-mi50-deepseek-v32#software-details)\n\n*   Ubuntu v24.04\n*   ROCM v6.3.4\n*   torch v2.9\n*   triton-gfx906 v3.5\n*   vllm-gfx906-deepseek v0.12.0 ([https://github.com/ai-infos/vllm-gfx906-deepseek/tree/gfx906/v0.12.0](https://github.com/ai-infos/vllm-gfx906-deepseek/tree/gfx906/v0.12.0))\n*   MI50 bios: 32G_UEFI.rom (available there: [https://gist.github.com/evilJazz/14a4c82a67f2c52a6bb5f9cea02f5e13](https://gist.github.com/evilJazz/14a4c82a67f2c52a6bb5f9cea02f5e13) /!\\ don't flash your bios if you don't know what you do; the stock bios might work in your setup)\n*   open-webui\n*   Custom motherboard bios to boot with 16 MI50: ask ASRock Rack support for this ROM or in the meantime, boot with 14 GPU and use hotplug to make it run with 16 under Ubuntu (see below for more details)\n\nRun 16 AMD MI50 under Ubuntu (required: hotplug support for the motherboard) if boot is capped at 14 GPU\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/ai-infos/guidances-setup-16-mi50-deepseek-v32#run-16-amd-mi50-under-ubuntu-required-hotplug-support-for-the-motherboard-if-boot-is-capped-at-14-gpu)\n\n1.

It would be great to have someone with AMD/ROCM kernel skills to work on it and improve this proposal!\n*   To me, it's worth it, because for now, having good speed in PP and TG requires a setup of 300k$ to run Deepseek...now with 16 MI50, that's around 1/100th the price for 1/10th the speed!\n\n**Credits: Global Open source Community**\n\nAbout\n-----\n\nGuidances for Test setup of 16 AMD MI50 32GB (for Deepseek v3.2)\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/ai-infos/guidances-setup-16-mi50-deepseek-v32#readme-ov-file)\n\n### Uh oh!\n\nThere was an error while loading.

Sopro is composed of dilated convs (à la WaveNet) and lightweight cross-attention layers, instead of the common Transformer architecture. Even though Sopro is not SOTA across most voices and situations, I still think it’s a cool project made with a very low budget (trained on a single L40S GPU), and it can be improved with better data.\n\nSome of the main features are:\n\n*   **169M parameters**\n*   **Streaming**\n*   **Zero-shot voice cloning**\n*   **0.25 RTF on CPU** (measured on an M3 base model), meaning it generates 30 seconds of audio in 7.5 seconds\n*   **3-12 seconds of reference audio** for voice cloning\n\n* * *\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\n[](https://github.com/samuel-vitorino/sopro#instructions)\nI only pinned the minimum dependency versions so you can install the package without having to create a separate env. However, some versions of Torch work best.

For example, `“1 + 2”` → `“1 plus 2”`. That said, Sopro can generally read abbreviations like “CPU”, “TTS”, etc.\n*   The streaming version is not bit-exact compared to the non-streaming version. For best quality, prioritize the non-streaming version.\n*   If you use torchaudio to read or write audio, ffmpeg may be required. I recommend just using soundfile.\n*   I will publish the training code once I have time to organize it.\n\nDue to budget constraints, the dataset used for training was pre-tokenized and the raw audio was discarded (it took up a lot of space). Later in training, I could have used the raw audio to improve the speaker embedding / voice similarity, because some nuances of voice are lost when you compress it with a neural codec into a discrete space.\n\nI didn't lose much time trying to optimize further, but there is still some room for improvement. For example, caching conv states.\n\nCurrently, generation is limited to **~32 seconds (400 frames)**. You can increase it, but the model generally hallucinates beyond that.\n\nAI was used mainly for creating the web demo, organizing my messy code into this repo, ablations and brainstorming.\n\nI would love to support more languages and continue improving the model.

Our approach employs a generator that rewrites real articles with factual perturbations, paired with a lightweight detector that verifies claims using dense passage retrieval. To enable effective co-evolution, we introduce verbal adversarial feedback (VAF). Rather than relying on scalar rewards, VAF issues structured natural-language critiques; these guide the generator toward more sophisticated evasion attempts, compelling the detector to adapt and improve. On a fake news detection benchmark, RADAR achieves 86.98% ROC-AUC, significantly outperforming general-purpose LLMs with retrieval. Ablation studies confirm that detector-side retrieval yields the largest gains, while VAF and few-shot demonstrations provide critical signals for robust training.\n\nSubjects:Computation and Language

In an effort to complement the ingrained \"knowledge\" of LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques have become widely popular. At its core, RAG involves the coupling of LLMs with domain-specific knowledge bases, whereby the generation of a response to a user question is augmented with contextual and up-to-date information. The proliferation of RAG has sparked concerns about data privacy, particularly with the inherent risks that arise when leveraging databases with potentially sensitive information. Numerous recent works have explored various aspects of privacy risks in RAG systems, from adversarial attacks to proposed mitigations. With the goal of surveying and unifying these works, we ask one simple question: What are the privacy risks in RAG, and how can they be measured and mitigated? To answer this question, we conduct a systematic literature review of RAG works addressing privacy, and we systematize our findings into a comprehensive set of privacy risks, mitigation techniques, and evaluation strategies. We supplement these findings with two primary artifacts: a Taxonomy of RAG Privacy Risks and a RAG Privacy Process Diagram. Our work contributes to the study of privacy in RAG not only by conducting the first systematization of risks and mitigations, but also by uncovering important considerations when mitigating privacy risks in RAG systems and assessing the current maturity of proposed mitigations.\n\nComments:17 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables.

However, extending this paradigm to financial decision is challenged by the market's stochastic nature: rewards are verifiable but inherently noisy, causing standard RL to degenerate into reward hacking. To address this, we propose Trade-R1, a model training framework that bridges verifiable rewards to stochastic environments via process-level reasoning verification. Our key innovation is a verification method that transforms the problem of evaluating reasoning over lengthy financial documents into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task. We construct a triangular consistency metric, assessing pairwise alignment between retrieved evidence, reasoning chains, and decisions to serve as a validity filter for noisy market returns. We explore two reward integration strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward (FSR) for stable alignment signals, and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward (DSR) for coupled magnitude optimization. Experiments on different country asset selection demonstrate that our paradigm reduces reward hacking, with DSR achieving superior cross-market generalization while maintaining the highest reasoning consistency.\n\nSubjects:Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Trading and Market Microstructure (q-fin.TR)\nCite as:[arXiv:2601.03948](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03948) [cs.AI]\n(or

In this work, we propose Decide Then Retrieve (DTR), a training-free framework that adaptively determines when retrieval is necessary and how external information should be selected. DTR leverages generation uncertainty to guide retrieval triggering and introduces a dual-path retrieval mechanism with adaptive information selection to better handle sparse and ambiguous queries. Extensive experiments across five open-domain QA benchmarks, multiple model scales, and different retrievers demonstrate that DTR consistently improves EM and F1 over standard RAG and strong retrieval-enhanced baselines, while reducing unnecessary retrievals.

Recent studies have demonstrated that retrieving neighbor sessions to augment the current session can effectively alleviate the data sparsity issue and improve recommendation performance. However, existing methods typically rely on explicitly observed session data, neglecting latent neighbors - not directly observed but potentially relevant within the interest space - thereby failing to fully exploit the potential of neighbor sessions in recommendation. To address the above limitation, we propose a novel model of diffusion-based latent neighbor generation for session-based recommendation, named DiffSBR. Specifically, DiffSBR leverages two diffusion modules, including retrieval-augmented diffusion and self-augmented diffusion, to generate high-quality latent neighbors. In the retrieval-augmented diffusion module, we leverage retrieved neighbors as guiding signals to constrain and reconstruct the distribution of latent neighbors. Meanwhile, we adopt a training strategy that enables the retriever to learn from the feedback provided by the generator. In the self-augmented diffusion module, we explicitly guide the generation of latent neighbors by injecting the current session's multi-modal signals through contrastive learning. After obtaining the generated latent neighbors, we utilize them to enhance session representations for improving session-based recommendation. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that DiffSBR generates effective latent neighbors and improves recommendation performance against state-of-the-art baselines.\n\nComments:This paper

However, their performance significantly degrades in specialized, culturally specific domains such as Vietnamese Traditional Medicine (VTM), primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality, structured benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce VietMed-MCQ, a novel multiple-choice question dataset generated via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with an automated consistency check mechanism. Unlike previous synthetic datasets, our framework incorporates a dual-model validation approach to ensure reasoning consistency through independent answer verification, though the substring-based evidence checking has known limitations. The complete dataset of 3,190 questions spans three difficulty levels and underwent validation by one medical expert and four students, achieving 94.2 percent approval with substantial inter-rater agreement (Fleiss' kappa = 0.82). We benchmark seven open-source models on VietMed-MCQ. Results reveal that general-purpose models with strong Chinese priors outperform Vietnamese-centric models, highlighting cross-lingual conceptual transfer, while all models still struggle with complex diagnostic reasoning. Our code and dataset are publicly available to foster research in low-resource medical domains.\n\nComments:11 pages, 4 figures.

In industrial-scale retrieval platforms, scalability is typically addressed through horizontal sharding and a combination of Approximate Nearest-Neighbor search, hybrid indexing, and optimized metadata filtering. Although effective from an efficiency perspective, these mechanisms rely on bottom-up, similarity-driven organization and lack a conceptual rationale for corpus partitioning. In this paper, we claim that the design of large-scale RAG systems may benefit from the combination of two orthogonal strategies: semantic clustering, which optimizes locality in embedding space, and multidimensional partitioning, which governs where retrieval should occur based on conceptual dimensions such as time and organizational context. Although such dimensions are already implicitly present in current systems, they are used in an ad hoc and poorly structured manner. We propose the Dimensional Fact Model (DFM) as a conceptual framework to guide the design of multidimensional partitions for RAG corpora. The DFM provides a principled way to reason about facts, dimensions, hierarchies, and granularity in retrieval-oriented settings. This framework naturally supports hierarchical routing and controlled fallback strategies, ensuring that retrieval remains robust even in the presence of incomplete metadata, while transforming the search process from a 'black-box' similarity matching into a governable and deterministic workflow. This work is intended as a position paper; its goal is to bridge the gap between OLAP-style multidimensional modeling and modern RAG architectures, and to stimulate further research on principled, explainable, and governable retrieval strategies at scale.\n\nSubjects:Information Retrieval (cs.IR); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)\nCite as:[arXiv:2601.03748](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03748)

Thus far, the role of the source of the retrieved information has gone unexamined. We address this gap with a novel framework to investigate how source preferences affect LLM resolution of inter-context knowledge conflicts in English, motivated by interdisciplinary research on credibility. With a comprehensive, tightly-controlled evaluation of 13 open-weight LLMs, we find that LLMs prefer institutionally-corroborated information (e.g., government or newspaper sources) over information from people and social media. However, these source preferences can be reversed by simply repeating information from less credible sources. To mitigate repetition effects and maintain consistent preferences, we propose a novel method that reduces repetition bias by up to 99.8%, while also maintaining at least 88.8% of original preferences. We release all data and code to encourage future work on credibility and source preferences in knowledge-intensive NLP.\n\nComments:Data and code: [this https URL](https://github.com/JaSchuste/llm-source-preference)\nSubjects:Computation and Language (cs.CL)\nACM classes:I.2.7\nCite as:[arXiv:2601.03746](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03746) [cs.CL]\n(or [arXiv:2601.03746v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03746v1) [cs.CL] for this version)\n[https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2601.03746](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2601.03746)\n\nFocus to learn more\n\n arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite (pending registration)\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\n From: Vagrant Gautam [[view email](http://arxiv.org/show-email/f677cf72/2601.03746)] \n\n**[v1]** Wed, 7 Jan 2026 09:35:35 UTC (489 KB)\n\n[](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03746v1)Full-text links:\nAccess Paper:\n-------------\n\n View a PDF of the paper titled Whose Facts Win?

RAGView provides a unified evaluation platform to benchmark different RAG methods on your specific data.\n\nURL Source: https://github.com/RagView/RagView\n\nMarkdown Content:\nWhy RagView?\n------------\n\n[](https://github.com/RagView/RagView#why-ragview)\nAs RAG technology continues to evolve, there are now nearly 60 distinct approaches, reflecting a stage of diversity and rapid experimentation. Depending on the scenario, different RAG solutions may yield significantly different outcomes in terms of recall rate, accuracy, and F1 score. Beyond accuracy, enterprises and individual developers must also weigh factors such as computational cost, performance, framework maturity, and scalability. However, there is currently no unified platform that consolidates and compares these RAG technologies. Developers and enterprises are often forced to download open-source code, deploy systems independently, and run manual evaluations—an inefficient and costly process.\n\n To address this gap, we are building RagView—a benchmarking and selection platform for RAG technologies, designed for both developers and enterprises. RagView provides standardized evaluation metrics, streamlined benchmarking workflows, intuitive visualization tools, and a modular plug-in architecture, enabling users to efficiently compare RAG solutions and select the approach best suited to their specific business needs.\n\n Today’s teams need a standardized rag evaluation process to compare diverse approaches fairly—using clear rag evaluation metrics (answer accuracy, context precision/recall, cost, and latency) and reproducible benchmarks. RagView centralizes this, so you can run apples-to-apples rag evaluation and pick what actually works for your domain.\n\nBasic Concepts\n--------------\n\n[](https://github.com/RagView/RagView#basic-concepts)\n### Terminology\n\n[](https://github.com/RagView/RagView#terminology)\n*   RAG solution: A RAG solution that follows the basic RAG workflow but applies special techniques in various components to improve recall and accuracy. The RAG solutions in RagView currently come from the open-source community; future plans include integrating commercial pipelines and implementing solutions from academic research.\n*   Document: The original form of knowledge in the RAG system, including text files (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and images (JPG, PNG, BMP). In the current version, only PDF is supported.\n*   Document Set: A collection of documents. In a RAG evaluation, this is the smallest unit of documents that is referenced.\n*   Test Set: A set of evaluation data that includes questions, the source text passages (which must be contained in documents of the document set) that a large model used as references to answer the questions, and the standard answers that the model is expected to generate based on those passages. In RAG evaluation, a test set is the smallest unit of test data referenced.\n*   RAG evaluation Task: Consists of one document set, one test set, and N user-selected RAG solutions; it executes the RAG evaluation and returns the results.A RAG evaluation task computes predefined rag evaluation metrics at both query-level and task-level for consistent, reproducible comparison.\n*   RAG evaluation count: A unit representing the complete evaluation of one RAG solution. If an evaluation task selects multiple solutions, it consumes multiple counts.\n\n### Functional Metrics\n\n[](https://github.com/RagView/RagView#functional-metrics)\nRagView reports core rag evaluation metrics that capture answer quality and retrieval quality: Answer Accuracy, Context Precision, and Context Recall. These rag evaluation signals reveal whether the system surfaces the right passages and uses them faithfully.\n\n*   Answer Accuracy: Measures how consistent the generated answer is with the reference answer; higher is better.\n*   Context Precision: Evaluates how accurate the retrieved relevant segments are for this RAG solution (i.e., the proportion of retrieved content that is actually relevant to the answer, considering ranking); higher is better.\n*   Context Recall: Measures how comprehensively the relevant segments are retrieved by this RAG solution; higher is better.\n\n### Performance Metrics\n\n[](https://github.com/RagView/RagView#performance-metrics)\nFor production decisions, efficiency matters. RagView treats latency, token consumption, and resource usage as first-class rag evaluation metrics, enabling cost-aware model and retriever choices.\n\n*   Token Consumption: The number of tokens consumed by various LLMs across different stages of the RAG solution (including preprocessing, indexing, retrieval, generation, etc.).\n*   Time: The time consumed by various components of the RAG solution, including preprocessing, indexing, retrieval, and generation.\n\nQuick Start\n-----------\n\n[](https://github.com/RagView/RagView#quick-start)\nWelcome to RagView.ai .\n\n In RagView, you can complete a RAG evaluation task quickly with just a few simple steps.\n\n1.   Upload Document Set: In Data Management, upload a set of documents to be retrieved during the RAG process. These documents will serve as the knowledge base for retrieval; different RAG solutions may use different chunking and retrieval methods on them.\n2.   Upload Test Set: In Data Management, upload the test data for evaluation. The test data includes the questions, the original text excerpts (from the document set) that the large model used for reference, and the reference standard answers. The test set should be prepared according to the provided sample file.\n3.   Launch Evaluation Task: In Evaluation Management, create a rag evaluation task, select the document set and test set, choose solutions, and pick the rag evaluation metrics to compute (e.g., answer accuracy, context precision/recall, latency).\n4.   View Evaluation Details: In Evaluation Management, after the task completes, click Details to view results. Based on the metrics you care about, select the suitable RAG solution and download the code for that pipeline.\n\n### Register / Login\n\n[](https://github.com/RagView/RagView#register--login)[](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/217898839/511905626-b87af339-c4d2-43c3-95bc-4c04cbc4ff2b.png?jwt=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3Njc5MjY1NTUsIm5iZiI6MTc2NzkyNjI1NSwicGF0aCI6Ii8yMTc4OTg4MzkvNTExOTA1NjI2LWI4N2FmMzM5LWM0ZDItNDNjMy05NWJjLTRjMDRjYmM0ZmYyYi5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjYwMTA5JTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI2MDEwOVQwMjM3MzVaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT0yMzhiZmFmNWM4MmZhNmM4YzY1MGFhM2QyOTY5YjI1NDJkYWRhY2ZkNDA2OWExY2Q0NTczMWJiYzMyNzc3ODFhJlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCJ9.Rz65V4qQYQs2ZZVD1JdSrKtcV_uzxuIC__nCTeNvTZY)\n[https://www.ragview.ai/login](https://www.ragview.ai/login)\n\nYou can register or log in using Google, GitHub, or email.\n\n### Upload Document Set\n\n[](https://github.com/RagView/RagView#upload-document-set)[](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/217898839/511905641-f5540bfe-17b1-44f0-97b3-200c18c73a03.png?jwt=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3Njc5MjY1NTUsIm5iZiI6MTc2NzkyNjI1NSwicGF0aCI6Ii8yMTc4OTg4MzkvNTExOTA1NjQxLWY1NTQwYmZlLTE3YjEtNDRmMC05N2IzLTIwMGMxOGM3M2EwMy5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjYwMTA5JTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI2MDEwOVQwMjM3MzVaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT0zMGZmNGRhNzRiYmQzZmM1NmY1YjhhNTI3MzcyODNjYWU4OGY5ZDVkNGYyNDkwMmFlZTIyMzE2NDBkMzM0ZjhlJlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCJ9.cWUVaQFVBBfGGq5MLH7z1cvNj6A_gKPuvJpvYv2rRps)\n[https://www.ragview.ai/components/dataset](https://www.ragview.ai/components/dataset)\n\n*   In Data Management, click Create Document Set to create an empty document set for storing documents to be retrieved.\n*   Click the Upload button to upload one or more documents to the document set.

A task with multiple solutions will consume multiple counts. You can purchase additional evaluation counts on the purchase page.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/RagView/RagView#frequently-asked-questions)\n1.   Is RagView open source?\n\n Answer: RagView currently has no open source plan, but we aim to cover hardware operating costs with relatively low fees. However, we will open-source our optimized RAG solutions.\n\n GitHub: [https://github.com/RagView/RagView](https://github.com/RagView/RagView).\n\n2.   How does RagView charge?\n\n Answer: We currently charge per evaluation count. In the future, pricing may align with tokens and runtime—both already tracked as rag evaluation metrics for transparency.\n\n3.   Can I automatically generate a test set from a document set?\n\n Answer: Yes. We plan to add a feature in version 1.1 to automatically generate a test set from the document set. With this feature, you will only need to click and wait for an LLM to generate QA pairs from the documents.\n\n4.   What is the format of the test set?\n\n Answer: The test set should be in XLSX or JSON format. Please refer to the sample file for the exact format.\n\n5.   What is the format of the document set?\n\n Answer: Currently, only PDF format is supported for documents. We plan to add support for image-based documents in future versions.\n\n6.   How can I view evaluation results?\n\n Answer: Go to the Evaluation Management page and open Details to review dashboards and downloadable reports of your rag evaluation metrics—including answer quality, context metrics, and efficiency.\n\n7.   How can I view the code for a RAG scheme?\n\n Answer: Currently, you will need to search for the RAG scheme by name on GitHub. In version 1.1, we will open-source the integrated code and provide a download link directly in the evaluation results.\n\n8.   Can RagView be used for commercial purposes?\n\n Answer: Yes, it can.\n\n9.   Can I compare my own RAG with open-source RAGs?\n\n Answer: We plan to support this in future versions. See our milestone plan (link) for details.\n\n10.   Which RAG schemes are already integrated into RagView?\n\n Answer: We have currently integrated R2R, LangFlow, and DocsGPT. In the future, we plan to add 1–2 new RAG schemes each week, depending on the availability and stability of open-source code. See our roadmap (link) for more details.\n\n11.   How can I contact you?\n\n Answer: You can contact us via email: [ragandview@gmail.com](mailto:ragandview@gmail.com)\n\nRagView Milestone Plan\n----------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/RagView/RagView#ragview-milestone-plan)\n### Key Features\n\n[](https://github.com/RagView/RagView#key-features)\n*   Test Set Auto-Generation: Based on the documents in the document set, use a naive chunking method and an LLM to automatically generate Q\u0026A pairs from each chunk, producing the test set data.\n*   Custom RAG Integration: Provide an SDK/API for developers to integrate their own RAG solutions into RagView, enabling comparison between their solutions and open-source solutions.\n*   Evaluation Task Optimization: Support setting up and comparing multiple configurations (different hyperparameters) of the same RAG solution.\n*   Evaluation Report Generation: Support automatic generation of PDF reports from evaluation results.\n\n### Usability Enhancements\n\n[](https://github.com/RagView/RagView#usability-enhancements)\n*   Email Notifications: Since evaluations are asynchronous and may take minutes to tens of minutes, add email notifications to inform users when evaluation results are ready.\n*   Result Charting: Generate bar charts, pie charts, radar charts, etc., based on metric scores to facilitate visual comparison.\n*   Hardware Resource Profiling: Collect statistics on hardware resource usage for different evaluation pipelines, aiding developers in assessing production feasibility.\n*   Optional Metrics: Make evaluation metrics optional (no longer mandatory), allowing users to select only the metrics they are interested in.\n\n### More RAG solutions\n\n[](https://github.com/RagView/RagView#more-rag-solutions)\nLegend:\n\n ✅ = Integrated | 🚧 = In Progress | ⏳ = Pending Integration\n\n| No. | Name | GitHub Link | Features | Status |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | Langflow | [langflow-ai/langflow](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow) | Build, scale, and deploy RAG and multi-agent AI apps.But we use it to build a naive RAG. | ✅ |\n| 1 | R2R | [SciPhi-AI/R2R](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R) | SoTA production-grade RAG system with Agentic RAG architecture and RESTful API support. | ✅ |\n| 2 | KAG | [OpenSPG/KAG](https://github.com/OpenSPG/KAG) | Retrieval framework combining OpenSPG engine and LLM, using logical forms for guided reasoning;

      "content": "In my previous company I had a Claude license and my work was basically interacting with Claude Code all day long. The code base was rather complex and I was automating testing and “DevOps” stuff for an embedded device development so Claude Code saved me tons of time (it was much faster to ask and tune that to do it all by myself).\n\nIm currently unemployed but got a freelancing gig and the company doesn’t provide access to commercial AI tools for contractors like me, but once again the work is rather demanding and I don’t think I’ll meet the deadlines without AI help (it’s a fairly old code base using mostly Java in a concurrent and distributed fashion), and of course due to compliance I can’t just use a license I paid for by myself.\n\nSo, in new to all this. To be honest I have very little hardware, as I would always prioritize power efficiency since I never really needed to do anything hardware intensive before (I don’t have a gaming PC or anything like that). I have an old HP Z2 G4 Tower I use as virtualization server and was thinking of getting a 3060 12GB for \\~300 USD (locally). Will I be able to run anything decent with that? Anything that would truly help me?\n\nI see everyone recommends a 3090 but I’d need a whole new PSU and build an entire computer around that. So that’d be roughly 2K USD (is it worth it? I don’t know, maybe?)\n\nWhat hardware is requires to run anything remotely close to Claude Code? Something like 6x3090s (144GB VRAM)?",

Good idea to buy used server EPYC hardware, even 8-channel DDR4 would be still much faster than any DDR5 dual channel RAM on gaming platforms, and connecting multiple GPUs works much better on server motherboards that have multilpe x16 slots and support bifurcation in case you need to plug-in more cards than there are full speed slots.",

          "content": "I did quickly throw the two papers into Gemini. It's really fun to live in the future. \n\n#Gemini summary: \n\nThe paper **\"DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning\"** (arXiv:2501.12948) marks a significant milestone in open-source AI by demonstrating that advanced reasoning (similar to OpenAI’s o1) can be achieved through large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) with minimal human-annotated data.\n\nThe two versions you provided represent the initial release (**v1**, Jan 22, 2025) and the latest updated version (which has been significantly expanded to **86+ pages** as of January 2026).\n\n### 1. Overall Paper Summary\nThe paper introduces two primary models:\n*   **DeepSeek-R1-Zero:** A model trained via \"pure RL\" (using the GRPO algorithm) starting directly from a base model without any Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). It demonstrates that reasoning behaviors like self-correction and reflection can emerge purely from reward signals.\n*   **DeepSeek-R1:** A more \"user-friendly\" version that uses a multi-stage pipeline (Cold-start SFT → Reasoning RL → Rejection Sampling/SFT → General RL) to fix the \"readability\" and \"language mixing\" issues of R1-Zero while maintaining state-of-the-art reasoning performance.\n*   **Distillation:** The authors show that the reasoning patterns discovered by the 671B model can be distilled into smaller models (1.5B to 70B), allowing a 14B model to outperform much larger ones on math and coding benchmarks.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Comparison: Extensions in the New Version\nThe newer version is a massive technical expansion (growing from roughly 22 pages to over 85 pages). The key additions and extensions include:\n\n#### A. The \"Aha Moment\" Expansion (Section 2.2.1)\nThe new version provides a much deeper analysis of the **\"Aha Moment\"**—the point during RL training where the model unexpectedly learns to \"re-think\" its approach. The extension includes more qualitative examples and internal data showing the model's transition from linear solving to iterative self-correction without being prompted to do so.\n\n#### B. Detailed 4-Stage Training Pipeline\nWhile v1 outlined the stages, the new version details the specific composition of the **800k total training samples**:\n*   **Stage 1 (Cold Start):** Expanded details on the ~5,000-10,000 long CoT (Chain of Thought) samples used to \"prime\" the model.\n*   **Stage 3 (Rejection Sampling):** A deeper dive into how 600k reasoning-related and 200k non-reasoning samples were filtered and used to improve the model's general chat capabilities and prevent \"forgetting\" during the reasoning-heavy RL stages.\n\n#### C. Comprehensive Ablation Studies\nThe new version adds extensive \"What if?\" scenarios that were absent or brief in v1:\n*   **Distillation vs. RL:** New evidence explaining *why* distilling a large model's reasoning traces into a small model is more effective than training that small model directly with its own RL.\n*   **Base Model Impact:** Analysis of how different base models (DeepSeek-V3 vs. Qwen vs. Llama) respond to the R1 training recipe.\n\n#### D. Expanded \"Unsuccessful Attempts\" (Section 4.2)\nOne of the most valuable additions for researchers is the expanded section on what **did not work**. The new version elaborates on their failures with:\n*   **Process Reward Models (PRM):** Detailed reasons why step-level rewards were difficult to scale or prone to \"reward hacking\" compared to the outcome-based rewards used in R1.\n*   **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):** Technical explanation of why MCTS didn't provide the expected gains over simple RL in the context of LLM reasoning.\n\n#### E. New Benchmarks \u0026amp; Technical Specs\n*   **Updated Results:** Includes more recent evaluations on benchmarks like **AIME 2025**, **LiveCodeBench**, and specialized medical/legal reasoning tests.\n*   **Hyperparameters:** The new version includes exhaustive tables of training hyperparameters (learning rates, GRPO group sizes, KL divergence coefficients) which were previously withheld or summarized.\n\n### Summary Table\n| Feature | v1 (Original) | Latest Version (Extension) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Page Count** | ~22 Pages | **86+ Pages** |\n| **Methodology** | High-level 4-stage overview | Granular detail on each stage (SFT, RL, Rejection Sampling) |\n| **Behaviors** | Mentions \"self-correction\" | Deep dive into \"Aha Moment\" with case studies |\n| **Failed Paths** | Brief mention of PRM/MCTS | Exhaustive analysis of why PRM and MCTS underperformed |\n| **Distillation** | Introduced 1.5B to 70B models | Added deep ablation on distillation efficiency and data filtering |\n| **Hyperparameters** | Partial/Summary | **Complete Technical Specs** for reproducibility |",

Recent breakthroughs, exemplified by large language models (LLMs) and chain-of-thought prompting, have achieved considerable success on foundational reasoning tasks. However, this success is heavily contingent upon extensive human-annotated demonstrations, and models' capabilities are still insufficient for more complex problems. Here we show that the reasoning abilities of LLMs can be incentivized through pure reinforcement learning (RL), obviating the need for human-labeled reasoning trajectories. The proposed RL framework facilitates the emergent development of advanced reasoning patterns, such as self-reflection, verification, and dynamic strategy adaptation. Consequently, the trained model achieves superior performance on verifiable tasks such as mathematics, coding competitions, and STEM fields, surpassing its counterparts trained via conventional supervised learning on human demonstrations. Moreover, the emergent reasoning patterns exhibited by these large-scale models can be systematically harnessed to guide and enhance the reasoning capabilities of smaller models.\n\nSubjects:Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG)\nCite as:[arXiv:2501.12948](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948) [cs.CL]\n(or

      "content": "I would like to ask the community to aid in the testing of the new autoparser mechanism that I've been cooking for llama.cpp for the past month or so. \n\nThe idea is to scrap the existing buggy mess of the chat parsers and replace it with a layered mechanism:  \n\\-\u0026gt; autoparser that handles 95%+ of typical chat templates for models  \n\\-\u0026gt; manual parsers / handlers for models that need something extra\n\nCurrently of all models that I've tested, only Ministral and GPT-OSS have shown the need to use a dedicated parser. I've tested the approach as extensively with as many models as I could, but I'm just a single dev doing this after hours, so I obviously can't do long coding sessions on all possible models. Therefore, I'd ask everyone who's able to test it with their favorite coding agent (I mostly used OpenCode and Roo, it's important to use an agent that actually uses tool calls, so Aider is out) because I'm quite sure there will be quite a few bugs.\n\nSince I don't want to clutter the main repo, please report all bugs with the autoparser to [https://github.com/pwilkin/llama.cpp/issues](https://github.com/pwilkin/llama.cpp/issues) instead.",

There was a worthwhile contribution by [@hksdpc255](https://github.com/hksdpc255) to add some XML toolcalling abstractions, but that was still just a patch on an open wound.\n\nThanks to [@aldehir](https://github.com/aldehir) and his PEG parser, I managed to create an autoparser mechanism, using all the currently supported templates, their parsers and test cases as base. The idea is simple: most models' syntax follows the general pattern of:\n\n`\u003creasoning_markers\u003e \u003creasoning_content\u003e \u003cend_of_reasoning_markers\u003e \u003ccontent_markers\u003e \u003cmain_content\u003e \u003cend_of_content_markers\u003e \u003ctool_call_markers\u003e ( \u003cjson\u003e | \u003cfunction marker\u003e \u003cargs json\u003e | \u003cfunction marker\u003e \u003cargs marker\u003e \u003cvalue json\u003e ) \u003cend_of_tool_call_marker\u003e`\n\nOf course, some elements might not be present in a given template, but that's the general structure. Since this is a pretty finite structure, it's possible to determine the relevant elements by differential analysis - similar to how Minja already does capability detection, but more fine-grained, because by comparing various template outputs, we get to actually extract the relevant markers.\n\nSome models will obviously not get handled so easily. However, in the course of implementing the mechanism, only two models remained that needed to get their separate parsers: Ministral and GPT-OSS, and the prior not because of its complexity, but of the need to rewrite the message structure passed to the template. GPT-OSS is a different beast since it supports arbitrarily many interleaved blocks, so it doesn't fit into the scheme that I mentioned above (but its parser has been rewritten to PEG as well).\n\nThis is currently anchored on Minja and uses its capability detection, but since the differential analysis already does its own capability detection, I fully expect to throw that part out and base this on [@ngxson](https://github.com/ngxson) 's [#18462](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/18462) instead.\n\nObsoletes [#18353](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/18353) (sorry [@ochafik](https://github.com/ochafik) - I know you put a lot of work into that).\n\nOld parsers, tests and all supporting code are thrown out, templates got new PEG-parser based testcases, all of them now also test streaming behavior. I have tested this extensively on agentic coding (mostly with OpenCode) to ensure that this actually works (my wish to refactor the parser code was mostly caused by my prior experience with agentic coding on llama.cpp, which was extremely buggy with a lot of models, this is an attempt to remedy that). Hopefully, having one unified codebase with a largely reduced line-of-code count will make it easier to fix any potential errors.\n\nThis also means that there is no longer need to provide support for new models' specific templates unless they have some odd constructs - they should be supported out of the box. There's a new tool called `debug-template-parser` that you can point to any Jinja template file or GGUF model with an embedded Jinja template and have it spit out the details of the generated autoparser + toolcaling grammar.\n\nOh, important note: _all_ Minja polyfills have been disabled. Working templates are now required. Why I see why a year and a half ago having proof-of-concept code that supported tool calling on models that didn't natively have tool calling might've been useless, right now supporting that is making it harder to properly support current and actually used models. Therefore, a functional template with tool calling is required if someone wants tool calling.\n\nI want to ask everyone from the community who can to test this. I will keep this branch current with master, I tried to test this as much as I could, but I'm just one person doing this after work, so obviously my testing abilities were limited. I will keep this as draft until I've gathered enough feedback and testing data.\n\nTo not clutter the main repository's issue tracker, please report bugs either (a) in this thread or (b) in my issue tracker [https://github.com/pwilkin/llama.cpp/issues](https://github.com/pwilkin/llama.cpp/issues)\n\nAI DISCLOSURE: Gemini Pro 3, Flash 3, Opus 4.5 and GLM 4.7 would like to admit that a human element did at some points interfere in the coding process, being as bold as to even throw most of the code out at some point and demand it rewritten from scratch. The human also tinkered the code massively, removing a lot of our beautiful comments and some code fragments that they claimed were useless. They had no problems, however, in using us to do all the annoying marker arithmetic. Therefore, we disavow any claim to this code and cede the responsibility onto the human.\n\nSorry, something went wrong.\n\n### Uh oh!\n\nThere was an error while loading.

What happens if the chat template requires additional arguments?\n\nYeah, it does differential analysis - it prepares different inputs to the template and then tests the outputs, for example, by using a the same function signature with a different name you can identify where the function name goes, by using the same function with one and two parameters you can identify how parameters are passed etc. etc.\n\nThe nice thing is, I managed to squish it to just 2k lines of code (1k for analysis and 1k for helpers), so it's not even that bloated.\n\nAs for custom inputs - I assume standard inputs here and that's what most template makers try to adhere to anyway. If not, you end up with a custom handler like for Ministral - but as a followup I want to separate handlers from parsers (since passing extra params is much eaasier than handling an entire template from scratch) or even add autodetection for common custom keywords (we're going to have to support \"reasoning\" in addition to \"reasoning_content\" at some point because vLLM is moving to that).\n\nAll reactions\n\nSorry, something went wrong.\n\n### Uh oh!\n\nThere was an error while loading.

In other words, the model’s behavior does not seem to be fully aligned with the assumptions made by the chat template. Is that understanding correct? I noticed that you have removed all parsers.\n\nAdditionally, I am planning to add a new custom parser for `MiroThinker`. Its official chat template does not accurately reflect the rendering logic actually used in their benchmarks. Is there a recommended starting point for implementing such a parser for the new parsing architecture?\n\nAll reactions\n\nSorry, something went wrong.\n\n### Uh oh!\n\nThere was an error while loading.

Install uv** (if you don't have it already):\n\n```\nuv --version\n# uv 0.9.18\n```\n\n**2. Run with the sample transcript**:\n\n```\nuv run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Liquid4All/cookbook/refs/heads/main/examples/meeting-summarization/summarize.py\n```\n\nNo API keys. No cloud services. No setup. Just pure local inference with real-time token streaming.\n\n**3. Use your own transcript**:\n\n```\nuv run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Liquid4All/cookbook/refs/heads/main/examples/meeting-summarization/summarize.py \\\n  --transcript-file path/to/your/transcript.txt\n```\n\nThe tool uses llama.cpp for optimized inference and automatically handles model downloading and compilation for your platform.\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/LiquidAI/LFM2-2.6B-Transcript#%F0%9F%8F%83-inference) 🏃 Inference\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLFM2 is supported by many inference frameworks.
