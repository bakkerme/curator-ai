      "content": "Hey everyone,\n​I’ve been reading the text of the \"NO FAKES Act\" currently in Congress, and it’s worse than I thought.\n​The Tldr: It creates a \"digital replica right\" for voices/likenesses. That sounds fine for stopping deepfake porn, but the liability language is a trap. It targets anyone who \"makes available\" a tool that is primarily used for replicas.  \n​The Problem: If you release a TTS model or a voice-conversion RVC model on HuggingFace, and someone else uses it to fake a celebrity, you (the dev) can be liable for statutory damages ($5k-$25k per violation).\n​There is no Section 230 protection here. This effectively makes hosting open weights for audio models a legal s*icide mission unless you are OpenAI or Google.\n\nWhat I did:\nI contacted my reps email to flag this as an \"innovation killer.\" If you run a repo or care about open weights, you might want to do the same. We need them to add a \"Safe Harbor\" for tool devs.\n\nS.1367 - 119th Congress (2025-2026): NO FAKES Act of 2025 | Congress.gov | Library of Congress https://share.google/u6dpy7ZQDvZWUrlfc",

If you're a developer and you release a tool that can be used to impersonate people, you're responsible.\n\nSo let's say you're all against that, alright, fair, what's the next step? What laws, what enforcement, how do we stop this?\n\nBecause \"we just have to learn to live with it\" is not gonna fly.",

This thing passes, then just take that out of your description and add a warning that you're expected to own the rights to any likeness you're duplicating.\n\nThis worry is pretty same as Photoshop being able to edit images you don't own. Photoshop doesn't spam 1000 times that you can steal copyright and must have written somewhere that copyright laws are your own problem somewhere.\n\nSo all that's left is probably actual heinous sites on the chopping block who should definitely be liable if their advertising is spamming how easy their tool will allow you to rip off likenesses and generate infringing content.",

My system ram is 96GB along with an Intel i7-9800x.  It blows my mind that with some tuning what difference it can make.  You really need to understand each of the commands for llama.cpp to get the most out of it especially with uneven vram like mine.  I used Chatgpt, Perplexity and suprisingly only Google AI studio could optimize my settings while teaching me along the way.\n\nCrazy how these two commands both fill up the ram but one is twice as fast as the other.

Would IQ4\\_XS or Q5\\_K\\_M be faster/better?\n5. **Low GPU power usage during inference?** My cards are power-limited to 275W each, but during inference they only draw \\~100-120W. Could this be a bottleneck limiting my token/s?\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts and any optimization tips.",

I tried with the latest ik\\_llama.cpp from git. But it sounds like you managed to get these options working?\n\nAs of your bottleneck, for token generation I think it is both your CPU and RAM. During token generation, all 64 cores on my EPYC 7763 get saturated a little bit sooner than memory bandwidth of 8-channel 3200MHz RAM, so any slower CPU would reduce the performance. This also means your rig is well balanced, faster memory would probably not make much difference, so your current memory is well suited for your CPU. 4 tokens/s is very good given your CPU and RAM speeds, probably GPUs help a lot.\n\nBut your prompt processing speed is unusually slow, you should be getting about the same speed as me (around 200 tokens/s) since prompt processing is done on GPUs and my CPU is almost idle while it happens. I see you have `--n-cpu-moe 68` \\- I did not try it myself, but very likely it is not equivalent to the proper `-ot` options. Calibrating `--tensor-split` and `-ot` lines to decide how many layers to put and where can be time consuming but I think it is necessary if you want to get the best performance. Notice how I have `exps=CPU` at the end - order is important. And you can manually write layers number from 3 and up in each `-ot` line, to define which layers go to which CUDA device - in my case I put 4 on my first GPU (CUDA0) and 5 layers on the rest, but depending on your VRAM usage by the system and other factors, you may need to change my example.",

The trick is to load with the override tensor flag as many layers as you can on the video cards without compromising too much with context. \n\nI'd suggest against quantizing the cache to even 8 bit as it brings spelling errors and slight hallucinations, it's tolerable for general conversation, not for coding or anything income related. \n\nAlso for ik_llama.cpp use Ubergarm's quants https://huggingface.co/ubergarm/GLM-4.7-GGUF or Thireus's, they are optimized for ik_llama.cpp and should give faster results. Ubergarm has an excellent readme with every trick to squeeze out performances.\n\nHow many ram sticks do you have? That epyc has an 8ch memory controller, if you have all the dimm slots occupied the ram bandwidth should be around double mine. I'd suggest measuring it with Intel MLC or a similar tool. Nevermind, read the comment about the processor having 2 ccds. So yeah, It's probably bottlenecking. I'd still try to squeeze out some more numbers.\n\nPersonally --n-cpu-moe never worked for me and gave sluggish speed, the -ot approach worked better, so I'd try that one. I'd also choose the smallest Q4 quant over the K_M one. Power limiting should not be an issue, you can monitor it with nvtop anyway to check if the gpus cap it.",

You'll save a lot of power, and end up with better performance.\n\nJokes aside, two things are killing your performance: that CPU and your RAM speed (you don't say how many sticks you have, so there's also a chance your memory configuration is bad if you have 4x64GB sticks).\n\nEpyc Rome and Milan have ~26GB/s bandwidth between each CCD and the IO die. To get maximum memory bandwidth, you need a CPU with 8 CCDs. Given the compute, 32 cores might not cut it, so you need either 48 or 64 cores to crunch those numbers. The IO die has 8 memory channels, each running at a maximum speed of 3200MT/s. You're running at 2133, which would be bad, if it wasn't for your CPU having 2 CCDs only cutting it's effective bandwidth by four.\n\nKnow thy hardware before buying parts and putting a system together. It's a bit of a moot point now that you have it, and with current RAM prices you'll probably need a kidney to upgrade to 3200 memory.

      "content": "Hey all! I'm sharing an updated version of my MCTS-for-conversations project. Instead of generating single responses, it explores entire conversation trees to find dialogue strategies and prunes bad paths. I built it to help get better research directions for projects, but it can be used for anything\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/shr3e0liv1cg1.png?width=2560\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=eec800c6dcd9f1a4fd033d003fe80e102cba8079\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS](https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS)\n\nMotivation: I like MCTS :3 and I originally wanted to make this a dataset-creation agent, but this is what it evolved into on its own. Basically:DTS runs parallel beam search over conversation branches. You give it a goal and opening message, and it:\n\n(Note: this isnt mcts. It's parallel beam search. UCB1 is too wild with llms for me)\n\n1. Generates N diverse strategies\n2. Forks each into user intent variants - skeptical, cooperative, confused, resistant (if enabled, or defaults to engaged + probing)\n3. Rolls out full multi-turn conversations down each branch\n4. Has 3 independent LLM judges score each trajectory, takes the median\n5. Prunes branches below threshold, backpropagates scores\n6. Repeats for however many rounds you configure\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zkii0idvv1cg1.png?width=762\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=905f9787a8b7c7bfafcc599e95a3b73005c331b4\n\nThree judges with median voting helps a lot with the LLM-as-judge variance problem from CAE. Still not grounded in anything real, but outlier scores get filtered. Research context helps but the scroing is still stochastic. I tried a rubric based approach but it was trash.\n\nMain additions over CAE:\n\n* user intent forking (strategies get stress-tested against different personas)\n* deep research integration via GPT-Researcher for domain context\n* proper visualization with conversation playback\n\nOnly supports openai compatible endpoints atm - works with whatever models you have access to there. It's token-hungry though, a full run can hit 300+ LLM calls depending on config. If running locally, disable parallel calls\n\nIt's open source (Apache 2.0) and I'm happy to take contributions if anyone wants to help out. Just a project.\n\n\\--\n\nBTW: Backend was done mostly by me as the planner/sys designer, etc + Claude Code for implementation/refactoring. Frontend was purely vibe coded.

So you have to take part in planning structural stuff. Either all by yourself or combo of you + LLM agent (it may give boost here too, by reviewing your ideas for missing corner cases or even noticing utterly wrong understanding of some stuff; also by suggesting tweaks). So this way you kinda know what to expect here.\n\nSo if you want to vibecode the whole thing and only review in the end - no, probably not the way unless coding agents get not only good quality, but actually superhuman quality. And even than - they would not be perfect decision mechanisms, so stacking them and human devs would still make sense. Because as soon as we make and notice different kind of errors - stacking different weak mechanisms would still work.\n\nIf you think about it like about pair programming, on the other hand - just a \"pair\" being not a human, but machine - it may start making sense,",

          "content": "Your CTO is totally right, and the problem he describes predates LLM codegen.  The advent of codegen has exacerbated problem tremendously, is all.\n\nPart of the problem in places I've worked is that management controls how much of developers' time is spend writing new code vs paying off technical debt, and management does not allocate enough time to paying off that debt.\n\nIn that sense, it is a people-problem, not a technical problem.  Fix management and the problem becomes a lot more tractable.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some things you can do to make LLM-inferred projects faster/easier to validate and review:\n\n**Write comprehensive unit tests**\n\nPreferably have the humans do this before codegen, because ideally unit tests will describe how code is expected to behave, which will help LLMs infer the expected code.  Not many devs like to write unit tests, though, so having your LLM generate unit tests after the fact is a second-best solution.  Note that you will need to instruct the LLM to write \"testable\" code, because sometimes the most natural-seeming implementations are not easily unit-tested.\n\nUnit tests with mocked dependencies are beneficial because they exercise the different parts of your project in isolation and verify that their outputs/side-effects comply with expectations.  This means you can find many bugs simply by running your unit tests, and which unit tests fail point you precisely at the code which needs to be fixed (if your tests are high-enough granularity, which requires that your functions/methods are decomposed into subroutines.  This is an important aspect of writing code to be testable).\n\nIt also makes adjusting the behavior of the project to comply with expectations easier, if you find that code does not do what you want it to do.  You can tweak the appropriate unit test(s), or write new tests, and have the dev or LLM fix the code so that the test passes.\n\nIt is good industry practice to make sure a development branch passes all unit tests before merging it into the main branch, and then making sure the merge passes all unit tests before pushing it to the remote repo.\n\n**Write good documentation**\n\nOne of the best uses I've found for codegen LLMs is to have them explain my coworkers' code to me.  Most codegen models (and some non-codegen models!) are good at writing code documentation.  This helps me come up to speed not just for code reviews but also for contributing to legacy projects with which I am familiar.\n\nIdeally you should have at least two layers of documentation, preferably three:\n\n* A high-level view, which is short and easy to read, explaining the purpose of the project, who is expected to use it, and for what, and the general flow of data through the project -- its inputs, its outputs, its side-effects, and the components it passes through in-between.\n\n* A component-level view, which describes the main subsystems involved in the project and their interfaces.  These can be libraries, external dependencies like databases or service APIs, frameworks, or any other reasonable-seeming partitioning of the project into a small handful of parts.  If you omit any documentation, it would be this one, not the high- or low-level views.\n\n* A low-level view, usually by source code file, which describes what the code in the file is for, what its classes and any global state are, the methods used by those classes, and what other files use those classes and/or call those methods.\n\nGood documentation will get the human reviewers up to speed quickly and let them start and finish their reviews more quickly.\n\n**Generate a list of possible bugs/problems**\n\nYou don't want to totally automate the code review process, but there's nothing wrong with asking the LLM to infer a list of what might be bugs or weaknesses in the project, for the human reviewers to assess.  When I ask GLM-4.5-Air to enumerate problems in my code, usually only about a third of the problems it identifies are actual problems which need fixing, but it's still better to have it than not.\n\nThis can help focus code reviewers' attention and at least give them something to consider, regarding whether the project should be better than it is.\n\n**Use a structured log**\n\nA lot of problems only become visible once you've been using a project for a while for real-world tasks.  A structured log will not only help you spot problems, but also expose the program's internal state in the steps leading up to the problem.  This is invaluable for rapid troubleshooting.\n\nWhen a problem crops up, you can look back through the log to identify exactly where things went awry, and use the conditions represented in the log to inform bugfixes and (especially!) new unit tests which would have identified the problem before it was put into production.\n\nStrictly speaking this is slightly out of scope for your problem, as the structured log only becomes useful *after* the code passes review and is put into production, but the simple fact is that not all problems get caught in code review.  Realistically new code needs to be vetted both before and after deployment.\n\n\n**These measures will accelerate code review, but the underlying problem persists.**\n\nIncorporating all of these measures can shorten the time it takes to review a project, but human reviewers still have to put in the work to verify that the code is good.  Depending on how many reviewers you have and how much code you are generating, they might or might not be able to keep up.\n\nWhether to bottleneck deployment of new code on code review, and how much, is and always has been a trade-off determined by the development team's management.  It is their job to assess the tradeoffs between releasing thoroughly-vetted code versus releasing possibly-buggy code and adding to the employer's technical debt.\n\nGenerating new code via LLM inference doesn't change that, but you should be able to demonstrate mathematically that given fixed human dev resources (say, programmer-hours per month, allocated to developing new code vs code reviews vs paying down technical debt), and given a fixed management tolerance for accumulating technical debt, the total useful code deployed per unit time is increased when LLMs generate at least some of the new code.",

It's a matter of doing the maths of which side you manage for what the product goals and roadmap is.  A pipe can only hold so much volume.  Right now you have pressure on the input side and it's more like a storm water drain than a filtered water outlet.  To strain the storm water you need a bigger pipe and grate which lets more things through.\n\nIt's up to the dev to ensure they are submitting quality pull requests.  If a PR comes in a human doesn't understand it then they have failed at their job.  If a reviewer finds a problem, it doesn't matter where it came from, that dev put in the PR - PRs have problems that's why we have them but to put one in that had no attempt to find the problems and submit understandable quality is egregious and if agents are writing code faster than the gates can handle then that's what's happening.\n\nPerformance objectives need to be updated to include appropriate use of AI. Everyone needs to be on the same page about what matters to your product, if some members of your team want to move faster than humans can understand and others want more thorough reviews then you have a culture problem that needs to be addressed.\n\nI mostly use AI for weird problems where I don't know where to start, like chunks of code I haven't touched before, then I take over and try to solve it myself where I can.  I use it to check the work I did for anything I missed, and you need to be careful with that too it can dream things so you need to know what you know to assess it. I also use it for bulk changes where it has a sample to go off for style and patterns.\n\nThe other day I had to put in a change that I didn't understand.  It was a legacy product in a framework I don't know and from top down they said they urgently need it and they are OK with AI writing it.  I reviewed it as best I could but I had no idea why it worked and in the PR I clearly stated that it was mostly AI written and I didn't fully understand how it works.  I'm a consultant and told them it's a bad idea, the owners said they wanted it, ok sure the people paying the bills get what they want.",

Some features:\n\n* 169M parameters\n* Streaming support\n* Zero-shot voice cloning\n* 0.25 RTF on CPU, meaning it generates 30 seconds of audio in 7.5 seconds\n* Requires 3-12 seconds of reference audio for voice cloning\n* Apache 2.0 license\n\nYes, I know, another English-only TTS model. This is mainly due to data availability and a limited compute budget. The model was trained on a single L40S GPU.\n\nIt’s not SOTA in most cases, can be a bit unstable, and sometimes fails to capture voice likeness. Nonetheless, I hope you like it!\n\nGitHub repo: [https://github.com/samuel-vitorino/sopro](https://github.com/samuel-vitorino/sopro)",

This allows the model to remember what it said 5-10 words ago and prevent complete drifting, which was a limitation of standard GRU.\n\n\n\nThis brings the attention cost to O(T³), but the model still remains faster than TinyStories-1M (50MB) for short bursts below \\~300 tokens when self attention becomes an overhead.\n\n  \nExample output(TinyStories-1M): \n\n\n\nPrompt: once upon a time\n\nOutput: once upon a time there was an old girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and pretend she was his friend. One day, they went outside to see the park. The sun looked blue and it had big eyes.\n\n\n\nLily's mom said \"Let me help you get my doll!\" They started to walk around the park and had lots of fun together. When it was dark and it seemed like something strange happened, a little bunny came up over to them.\n\n\n\n\"Hello there,\" said Mom. \"It's so pretty.\"\n\n\n\nThe bunny smiled at Lily and said, \"Yes! I'm glad we can find some more toys later.\" Then he opened his backpack and found that she was able to provide for him in a special place where he could have all the toys ready!\n\n(165 words, 67.97 it/s) (could be roughly around 200 chars/sec for BPE tokeniser)\n\n  \ntinystoriesgru:\n\n  \nPrompt: once upon a time  \nOutput: once upon a time to hear the wolf with a smile on his face.

The code base was rather complex and I was automating testing and “DevOps” stuff for an embedded device development so Claude Code saved me tons of time (it was much faster to ask and tune that to do it all by myself).\n\nIm currently unemployed but got a freelancing gig and the company doesn’t provide access to commercial AI tools for contractors like me, but once again the work is rather demanding and I don’t think I’ll meet the deadlines without AI help (it’s a fairly old code base using mostly Java in a concurrent and distributed fashion), and of course due to compliance I can’t just use a license I paid for by myself.\n\nSo, in new to all this. To be honest I have very little hardware, as I would always prioritize power efficiency since I never really needed to do anything hardware intensive before (I don’t have a gaming PC or anything like that). I have an old HP Z2 G4 Tower I use as virtualization server and was thinking of getting a 3060 12GB for \\~300 USD (locally). Will I be able to run anything decent with that? Anything that would truly help me?\n\nI see everyone recommends a 3090 but I’d need a whole new PSU and build an entire computer around that. So that’d be roughly 2K USD (is it worth it? I don’t know, maybe?)\n\nWhat hardware is requires to run anything remotely close to Claude Code? Something like 6x3090s (144GB VRAM)?",

Good idea to buy used server EPYC hardware, even 8-channel DDR4 would be still much faster than any DDR5 dual channel RAM on gaming platforms, and connecting multiple GPUs works much better on server motherboards that have multilpe x16 slots and support bifurcation in case you need to plug-in more cards than there are full speed slots.",

          "content": "I did quickly throw the two papers into Gemini. It's really fun to live in the future. \n\n#Gemini summary: \n\nThe paper **\"DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning\"** (arXiv:2501.12948) marks a significant milestone in open-source AI by demonstrating that advanced reasoning (similar to OpenAI’s o1) can be achieved through large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) with minimal human-annotated data.\n\nThe two versions you provided represent the initial release (**v1**, Jan 22, 2025) and the latest updated version (which has been significantly expanded to **86+ pages** as of January 2026).\n\n### 1. Overall Paper Summary\nThe paper introduces two primary models:\n*   **DeepSeek-R1-Zero:** A model trained via \"pure RL\" (using the GRPO algorithm) starting directly from a base model without any Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). It demonstrates that reasoning behaviors like self-correction and reflection can emerge purely from reward signals.\n*   **DeepSeek-R1:** A more \"user-friendly\" version that uses a multi-stage pipeline (Cold-start SFT → Reasoning RL → Rejection Sampling/SFT → General RL) to fix the \"readability\" and \"language mixing\" issues of R1-Zero while maintaining state-of-the-art reasoning performance.\n*   **Distillation:** The authors show that the reasoning patterns discovered by the 671B model can be distilled into smaller models (1.5B to 70B), allowing a 14B model to outperform much larger ones on math and coding benchmarks.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Comparison: Extensions in the New Version\nThe newer version is a massive technical expansion (growing from roughly 22 pages to over 85 pages). The key additions and extensions include:\n\n#### A. The \"Aha Moment\" Expansion (Section 2.2.1)\nThe new version provides a much deeper analysis of the **\"Aha Moment\"**—the point during RL training where the model unexpectedly learns to \"re-think\" its approach. The extension includes more qualitative examples and internal data showing the model's transition from linear solving to iterative self-correction without being prompted to do so.\n\n#### B. Detailed 4-Stage Training Pipeline\nWhile v1 outlined the stages, the new version details the specific composition of the **800k total training samples**:\n*   **Stage 1 (Cold Start):** Expanded details on the ~5,000-10,000 long CoT (Chain of Thought) samples used to \"prime\" the model.\n*   **Stage 3 (Rejection Sampling):** A deeper dive into how 600k reasoning-related and 200k non-reasoning samples were filtered and used to improve the model's general chat capabilities and prevent \"forgetting\" during the reasoning-heavy RL stages.\n\n#### C. Comprehensive Ablation Studies\nThe new version adds extensive \"What if?\" scenarios that were absent or brief in v1:\n*   **Distillation vs. RL:** New evidence explaining *why* distilling a large model's reasoning traces into a small model is more effective than training that small model directly with its own RL.\n*   **Base Model Impact:** Analysis of how different base models (DeepSeek-V3 vs. Qwen vs. Llama) respond to the R1 training recipe.\n\n#### D. Expanded \"Unsuccessful Attempts\" (Section 4.2)\nOne of the most valuable additions for researchers is the expanded section on what **did not work**. The new version elaborates on their failures with:\n*   **Process Reward Models (PRM):** Detailed reasons why step-level rewards were difficult to scale or prone to \"reward hacking\" compared to the outcome-based rewards used in R1.\n*   **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):** Technical explanation of why MCTS didn't provide the expected gains over simple RL in the context of LLM reasoning.\n\n#### E. New Benchmarks \u0026amp; Technical Specs\n*   **Updated Results:** Includes more recent evaluations on benchmarks like **AIME 2025**, **LiveCodeBench**, and specialized medical/legal reasoning tests.\n*   **Hyperparameters:** The new version includes exhaustive tables of training hyperparameters (learning rates, GRPO group sizes, KL divergence coefficients) which were previously withheld or summarized.\n\n### Summary Table\n| Feature | v1 (Original) | Latest Version (Extension) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Page Count** | ~22 Pages | **86+ Pages** |\n| **Methodology** | High-level 4-stage overview | Granular detail on each stage (SFT, RL, Rejection Sampling) |\n| **Behaviors** | Mentions \"self-correction\" | Deep dive into \"Aha Moment\" with case studies |\n| **Failed Paths** | Brief mention of PRM/MCTS | Exhaustive analysis of why PRM and MCTS underperformed |\n| **Distillation** | Introduced 1.5B to 70B models | Added deep ablation on distillation efficiency and data filtering |\n| **Hyperparameters** | Partial/Summary | **Complete Technical Specs** for reproducibility |",
