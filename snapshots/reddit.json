      "content": "***Year end thread for the best LLMs of 2025!***\n\n2025 is almost done! Its been **a wonderful year** for us Open/Local AI enthusiasts. And its looking like Xmas time brought some great gifts in the shape of Minimax M2.1 and GLM4.7 that are touting frontier model performance. Are we there already? are we at parity with proprietary models?!\n\n**The standard spiel:**\n\nShare what your favorite models are right now **and why.** Given the nature of the beast in evaluating LLMs (untrustworthiness of benchmarks, immature tooling, intrinsic stochasticity), please be as detailed as possible in describing your setup, nature of your usage (how much, personal/professional use), tools/frameworks/prompts etc.\n\n**Rules**\n\n1. Only open weights models\n\n\n\n*Please thread your responses in the top level comments for each Application below to enable readability*\n\n**Applications**\n\n1. **General**: Includes practical guidance, how to, encyclopedic QnA, search engine replacement/augmentation\n2. **Agentic/Agentic Coding/Tool Use/Coding**\n3. **Creative Writing/RP**\n4. **Speciality**\n\nIf a category is missing, please create a top level comment under the Speciality comment\n\n\n\n**Notes**\n\nUseful breakdown of how folk are using LLMs: [https://preview.redd.it/i8td7u8vcewf1.png?width=1090\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=423fd3fe4cea2b9d78944e521ba8a39794f37c8d](https://preview.redd.it/i8td7u8vcewf1.png?width=1090\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=423fd3fe4cea2b9d78944e521ba8a39794f37c8d)  \n\n\nA good suggestion for last time, breakdown/classify your recommendation by model memory footprint: (you can and should be using multiple models in each size range for different tasks)\n\n* Unlimited: \u0026gt;128GB VRAM \n* Medium: 8 to 128GB VRAM\n* Small: \u0026lt;8GB VRAM",

So grateful to get to witness all this rapid change in first person view. Rad stuff. Our phones are talking back. \n\n\nAlso wanna say thanks to qwen folks for all consumer gpu sized models like qwen 4b instruct and the 30b 3a variants including vl versions. Nemotron 30b 3a is still a little difficult to get a handle on but it showed me we are in a whole new era of micro scaled intelligence in little silicon boxes with it ability to 4x generation speed and huge context with llama.cpp on 8k quant cache settings omgg chefs kiss.

The Nemotron releases this year were good but the datasets are more interesting. Seed OSS 36B was interesting.\n\nAll of the models from the REAP collection, Tesslate's T3 models are better than GPT-5 or Gemini3 for TailwindCSS, GPT-OSS 120B is decent at developer culture, the THRIFT version of MiniMaxM2 VibeStudio/MiniMax-M2-THRIFT is the best large MoE for code gen.\n\nQwen3 NEXT 80B A3B is pretty good but support is still maturing in llamacpp, althrough progress has accelerated in the last month.\n\nIBM Granite family was solid af this year. Docling is worth checking out too.\n\nKittenTTS is still incredible for being 25MB. I just shipped something with it for on device TTS. Soprano sounds pretty good for what it is. FasterWhisper is still the best STT I know of.\n\nQwen-Image, Qwen-Image-Edit, Qwen-Image-Layered are basically free Nano-Banana\n\nWan2.1 and 2.2 with LoRAs is comparable to Veo. If you add comfyui nodes you can get some crazy stuff out of them.\n\nZ-Image deserves a mention but I still favor Qwen-Image family.\n\nThey're not models, but they are model citizens of a sort... Noctrex and -p-e-w- deserve special recognition as two of the biggest most unsung heroes and contributors this year to the mission of LocalLLama.",

      "content": "Hey r/LocalLLaMA,\n\nWe’re back with another **ShapeLearn** GGUF release ([Blog](https://byteshape.com/blogs/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507/), [Models](https://huggingface.co/byteshape/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-GGUF)), this time for a model that *should not* feel this usable on small hardware… and yet here we are:\n\n**Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507** (device-optimized quant variants, llama.cpp-first).\n\nWe’re optimizing for TPS on a specific device without output quality falling off a cliff.\n\nInstead of treating “smaller” as the goal, we treat memory as a budget: Fit first, then optimize TPS vs quality.\n\nWhy? Because llama.cpp has a quirk: “Fewer bits” does *not* automatically mean “more speed.”\n\nDifferent quant formats trigger different kernels + decode overheads, and on GPUs you can absolutely end up with **smaller and slower**.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Yes, a 30B runs on a Raspberry Pi 5 (16GB). We achieve **8.03 TPS** at 2.70 BPW, while retaining **94.18% of BF16 quality**.\n* Across devices, the pattern repeats: ShapeLearn tends to find better TPS/quality tradeoffs versus alternatives (we compare against Unsloth and MagicQuant as requested in our previous post).\n\n# What’s new/interesting in this one\n\n**1) CPU behavior is… sane (mostly)**\n\nOn CPUs, once you’re past “it fits,” **smaller tends to be faster** in a fairly monotonic way. The tradeoff curve behaves like you’d expect.\n\n**2) GPU behavior is… quirky (kernel edition)**\n\nOn GPUs, performance depends as much on **kernel choice** as on memory footprint. So you often get **sweet spots** (especially around \\~4b) where the kernels are “golden path,” and pushing lower-bit can get weird.\n\n# Request to the community 🙏\n\nWe’d *love* feedback and extra testing from folks here, especially if you can run:\n\n* different llama.cpp builds / CUDA backends,\n* weird batch sizes / context lengths,\n* real workloads (coding assistants, long-form, tool-ish prompts),\n* or non-NVIDIA setups (we’re aware this is where it gets spicy).\n\nAlso: we heard you on the previous Reddit post and are actively working to improve our evaluation and reporting. Evaluation is currently our bottleneck, not quantization, so if you have strong opinions on what benchmarks best match real usage, we’re all ears.",

Once it fits, making the file smaller isn't a goal by itself. We only shrink further when it also improves the real tradeoff people care about: **speed vs. quality**.\n\nApproaching bitlength learning this way matters because in llama.cpp, \"fewer bits\" doesn't automatically mean \"more speed.\" Different quantization formats can trigger different kernels and overheads, and on some GPUs, **going lower-bit can even get slower**, despite using less memory.\n\n**Bottom line:** treat memory as a **budget** to meet, then optimize what matters most: **TPS and quality**.\n\n[Try Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507](https://huggingface.co/byteshape/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-GGUF)\n\nTL;DR\n-----\n\nYes, this 30B Qwen3 runs on a Raspberry Pi. On a Pi 5 (16GB), \n```\nQ3_K_S-2.70bpw [KQ-2]\n```\n hits 8.03 TPS at 2.70 BPW and maintains 94.18% of BF16 quality. It genuinely feels real-time. More broadly, the same pattern shows up everywhere else: ByteShape models give you a better TPS/quality tradeoff than the alternatives (here we look at Unsloth and MagicQuant).\n\nCPUs\n----\n\nOn CPUs, the reducing footprint via shorter bitlengths affects the TPS and accuracy tradeoff as one would expect: once the model fits, reducing footprint tends to increase TPS in a fairly monotonic way. If datatypes are selected correctly, you can trade a bit of quality for speed predictably, which makes it much easier to pick a point on the curve that matches your constraints.\n\nWe'll start with the most memory-constrained CPU case (Raspberry Pi 5 16GB), where \"fits in RAM\" is the limiting factor, then move to an Intel i7 with 64GB, where everything fits.\n\n### Raspberry Pi 5\n\nThe figure below shows TPS vs. normalized accuracy for the models that fit in RAM on the Raspberry Pi 5 16GB.\n\n Raspberry Pi 5: Tokens per second vs quality (bubble size = model footprint) \n\n Raspberry Pi 5: Tokens per second vs quality (bubble size = model footprint) \n\nNotably, sustaining **8.5 TPS at 92%+ baseline accuracy** with a 30B model on a Raspberry Pi reshapes expectations for Pi-class systems. Overall, the trend shows that ShapeLearn consistently produces better models, with ByteShape trending up and to the right of Unsloth, achieving higher tokens per second at the same quality, or higher quality at the same throughput.\n\nWe highlight choices for two primary objectives: accuracy or response time.\n\n*   **Optimizing for response time while maintaining accuracy:** For interactive, on-device use, perceived responsiveness is driven by how quickly text appears, not peak throughput. In practice, generation feels real-time once it reaches roughly **8 TPS**, comfortably above typical reading speed. In this Raspberry Pi real-time regime, \n```\nQ3_K_S-2.70bpw [KQ-2]\n```\n (2.70 BPW, 8.03 TPS, 94.18% accuracy) is our go-to recommendation: it crosses the real-time threshold while maintaining high accuracy. Compared to Unsloth models at similar quality, ByteShape achieves real-time performance at lower BPW and higher TPS, making it the more efficient choice for interactive edge deployment. \n*   **Accuracy above all:** The table below lists the models that achieve the highest accuracy while still being able to run on a Raspberry Pi. Within this set, ByteShape models make the best use of the available resources to maximize accuracy, occupying the **lowest-error rows** (~1.1–1.3% relative error, ~98.8% accuracy), while the strongest Unsloth entries remain around 2.1–2.2% error (~97.9% accuracy). Compared to Unsloth's `UD-Q3_K_XL [8]`, ByteShape achieves up to a **1.87× lower error rate** while still operating at **~5–6 TPS**, comfortably within TPS-norms on Raspberry PI making it the better choice when accuracy is the priority. \n\n Even when prioritizing maximum speed with some reduction in accuracy, \n```\nQ3_K_S-3.25bpw [KQ-5]\n```\n offers a better tradeoff: **more accurate, smaller, and faster** than the fastest Unsloth model. \n\n| Model | Relative Error | BPW | TPS |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ``` Q4_K_S-3.92bpw [KQ-7] ``` | 1.14% | 3.92 | 5.30 |\n| ``` Q4_K_S-3.61bpw [KQ-6] ``` | 1.25% | 3.61 | 5.94 |\n| ``` Q3_K_S-3.25bpw [KQ-5] ``` | 2.03% | 3.25 | 6.68 |\n| `UD-IQ3_XXS [6]` | 2.22% | 3.38 | 5.03 |\n| `UD-Q3_K_XL [8]` | 2.13% | 3.62 | 6.28 |\n\nMany other Unsloth and MagicQuant models (some of ours too!) are not in this chart. We compare them in other sections, but they're not applicable in the Raspberry Pi case. They simply don't fit!\n\n### Intel i7\n\nNext, we move to the Intel i7 with 64GB RAM. The figure below shows TPS vs normalized accuracy for all models.\n\n Intel i7: Tokens per second vs quality (bubble size = model footprint) \n\n Intel i7: Tokens per second vs quality (bubble size = model footprint) \n\nOverall, ByteShape models outperform both Unsloth and MagicQuant, delivering higher quality at comparable throughput using fewer bits per parameter. Only ByteShape offers models that run in the 26+ TPS range, extending performance well beyond the other methods.\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n*   **Quality-first:** At the high-accuracy end of the table, \n```\nIQ4_XS-4.67bpw [KQ-9]\n```\n achieves the lowest relative error (0.25%), outperforming the best-running Unsloth models (`Q6_K [20]` and `Q5_K_M [18]` whose relative errors are 0.36% and 0.44%). Compared directly, ByteShape delivers up to a 1.44× lower error rate with higher throughput than `Q6_K [20]`, and a 1.76× lower error rate at essentially the same speed as `Q5_K_M [18]`. MagicQuant `mxfp4 [3]` trails in this regime, with both higher error and lower TPS. \n*   **Balanced point:** In the mid-accuracy, high-throughput region, \n```\nQ3_K_S-3.25bpw [KQ-5]\n```\n combines ~98% accuracy with 23.1 TPS at just 3.25 BPW, offering the best overall balance in the table. Matching or exceeding this accuracy with Unsloth (`IQ4_XS [10]`) requires higher BPW and lower TPS, while choosing an Unsloth model closer in speed (`Q3_K_S [7]`) incurs a 1.73× higher error rate. MagicQuant does not offer a competitive model in this range; its fastest entry (`IQ4_NL [2]`) is behind both ByteShape and Unsloth in accuracy and throughput. \n\n**Takeaway:** Across both quality-first and balanced settings, ByteShape consistently converts the available bit budget into either higher accuracy or higher TPS, and is the only approach that simultaneously covers the high-quality and 26+ TPS balanced-performance regions in this comparison.\n\nGPUs: RTX5090/32GB and RTX4080/16GB\n-----------------------------------\n\nOn GPUs, performance depends as much on **kernel choice** as on raw memory footprint. For matmul/matvec, llama.cpp's quantization-specific GPU decode paths incur very different overheads, so fewer bits per weight do **not** reliably translate to higher TPS. Instead, TPS often peaks at quantization-specific sweet spots. Pushing BPW lower can even **increase VRAM traffic and instruction count**, hurting performance rather than improving it. We dig into this behavior in more detail right after the GPU results section, where the kernel-level tradeoffs become more apparent.\n\nWe evaluate on two GPUs: an **RTX 5090 (32 GB)**, which can run models **above 4 BPW** and typically reach the fastest sweet spots, and an **RTX 4080 (16 GB)**, where **\u003e4 BPW models do not fit**, forcing different trade-offs and making the device-optimized curve easier to see.\n\n### RTX 5090 (32GB of VRAM)\n\nLet's start with the 5090, which has enough VRAM to support all of the quantized models. The figure below shows TPS vs normalized accuracy.\n\n RTX 5090: Tokens per second vs quality (bubble size = model footprint) \n\n RTX 5090: Tokens per second vs quality (bubble size = model footprint) \n\nTwo things stand out immediately:\n\n First, this GPU shows a clear **~4-bit sweet spot**: several ~4b models cluster at very high TPS with nearly identical quality. Examples include `Unsloth Q4_0 [12]`, `Unsloth IQ4_XS [10]`, \n```\nIQ4_XS-3.87bpw [IQ-6]\n```\n , and MagicQuant `iq4_nl-EHQKOUD-IQ4NL [1]`, all running around ~302–303 TPS at ~98.4–98.9% accuracy. Within this tight cluster, Unsloth edges out slightly in throughput and quality.\n\nSecond, outside of that sweet spot, the tradeoff becomes much more uneven:\n\n*    Many other Unsloth and Magic Quant models show **significantly lower TPS**, regardless of whether they are quantized more or less aggressively. \n*    Past the ~4b region, only ByteShape continues to increase TPS with a more predictable reduction in quality. \n\n**Accuracy-critical workloads:** when output quality is paramount, ByteShape delivers the most accurate model on the 5090: \n```\nIQ4_XS-4.67bpw [IQ-8]\n```\n (4.67 BPW, 272.98 TPS, 99.75% accuracy). It surpasses `Unsloth Q6_K [20]` (6.57 BPW, 264.88 TPS, 99.64% accuracy) while using fewer bits and achieving slightly higher throughput, and it clearly outperforms MagicQuant `mxfp4_moe-H-B16-EUR-IQ4NL-KO-Q5K-QD-Q6K [3]` (5.46 BPW, 240.42 TPS, 99.32% accuracy) in both accuracy and speed, making it the strongest choice when accuracy is a task-critical deployment requirement.\n\n**Practical takeaway.** If your GPU has enough VRAM to run a strong ~4b model that already meets your speed and accuracy requirements, that cluster is an excellent default. The curve becomes more interesting when task-critical deployment constraints demand higher accuracy or smaller models as for example, under tighter memory budgets or constrained environments (as we'll see on the 4080).\n\n### RTX 4080 (16GB of VRAM)\n\nNext, let's move to a more accessible GPU, especially in these memory-challenged times. The biggest stumbling block for the 4080 is its 16GB of VRAM, which is not sufficient to support the \"magical\" ~4b quantizations for a 30B model. How convenient!This \"avoids\" the 5090's ~4b sweet spot and forces a more \"real-world\" comparison under a hard VRAM budget. The figure below shows TPS versus normalized accuracy for all models that fit on the 4080.\n\n RTX 4080: Tokens per second vs quality (bubble size = model footprint) \n\n RTX 4080: Tokens per second vs quality (bubble size = model footprint) \n\nOn the RTX 4080, ByteShape consistently outperforms Unsloth under the same 16 GB VRAM constraint, delivering a better TPS–quality tradeoff.\n\nIn particular, ByteShape's highest-quality model that fits, \n```\nIQ4_XS-3.87bpw [IQ-6]\n```\n (3.87 BPW, 214.81 TPS, 98.66% accuracy) delivers:\n\n*    a 1.59× lower error rate and 9.4% higher TPS vs. `Unsloth Q3_K_XL [8]` (3.62 BPW, 196.42 TPS, 97.87% accuracy). \n*    a 2.54× lower error rate at the same TPS vs. `Unsloth IQ2_M [2]` (2.84 BPW, 214.79 TPS, 96.59% accuracy). \n\nAs we move to higher throughput, ByteShape's maintains accuracy, while Unsloth's error rate experiences a cliff.\n\n### The Elephant in the Room: When 3-bits is not just 3-bits\n\nThere is an inconvenient truth hiding in these results. On several setups, around 4 bpw is already flying, and pushing quantization harder does not make things faster. It just manages to be smaller and slower at the same time.\n\nReducing the size of data doesn't automatically speed things up. While using fewer bits to store each number seems like it should reduce memory traffic and speed up computation, GPUs don't work that way. NVIDIA GPUs process work in fixed groups of 32 threads called \"warps,\" which move through instructions together in near lock-step. The GPU hardware is optimized for specific data formats, memory access patterns, and operations that the chip's circuits are physically designed to handle efficiently. When your workload matches these \"golden paths\", you get peak performance. Step outside them, and you hit slowdowns. This isn't a design flaw, it's a deliberate tradeoff. Supporting more flexibility would require additional circuitry: more wires, more transistors, more complexity. That extra hardware consumes more power and adds latency to every operation, whether a program needs that flexibility or not.\n\nHere a few examples of relevant hardware \"quirks\": VRAM is read in aligned 32-byte blocks, so reading one or 32 bytes consumes the same memory bandwidth. Both on-chip and off-chip memories can also suffer contention depending on how data is laid out, meaning that a warp's accesses may complete in a single step or, in the worst case, be serialized into 32 steps. And of course, decoding quantized values before computation can require extra instructions, with the cost depending on the quantization scheme.\n\nThis explains the behaviour we observe: 4-bit kernels use VRAM bandwidth more efficiently than 3- or 2-bit kernels and require fewer decode steps before computation. At the same time, 4-bit kernels exploit subword parallelism just as effectively as lower-bit kernels, and all rely primarily on dynamic caches rather than shared memory to take advantage of data reuse when possible.\n\nSo why llama.cpp hasn't been optimized to deliver peak speed for **every** bit-length? Our understanding is that llama.cpp prioritizes **portable, space-efficient quantization** that can run across a wide range of hardware. That design goal limits how aggressively backends can reshape data layouts or reorder computation in ways that might help one GPU or one bit-width.\n\nA key example is its choice to store quantized weights in fixed blocks of 256 values. Each block is self-contained (it carries everything needed to decode it) and sits at a simple, predictable offset in the tensor, which makes the format easy to implement and fast to locate.\n\nThe tradeoff is that GPUs often need to **decode many blocks in parallel** to keep their wide compute units busy. With many independent 256-value blocks, those parallel decodes can translate into more scattered or fragmented VRAM reads and extra decode overhead, reducing bandwidth efficiency, especially for some lower-bit formats.\n\n**Point for example on RTX 5090:** a matrix multiply [256, 768] × [768, 2048] takes **~54µs with**`iq4_xs`datatype, but **~62µs with**`iq3_xxs`(mul_mat_q()+mul_mat_q_stream_k_fixup()). In other words, **cutting nearly 1.2 bits per weight**(a reduction of more than 25% in weight footprint) leads to a **~13% slowdown**, directly hurting user experience.\n\nAn excellent reminder that bitlength learning matters: Heuristics can get us part of the way, but not all the way. ShapeLearn makes deliberate, per-tensor datatype choices that improve speed without sacrificing accuracy.\n\nMethodology (brief recap)\n-------------------------\n\nIf you're wondering how we are scoring these points, the full methodology is discussed in our previous [blog post](https://byteshape.com/blogs/Qwen3-4B-I-2507/). This post is intentionally focused on the curves and device tradeoffs, so here is the quick version.\n\nFor each quantized variant, we measure **throughput (TPS)** on the target device and compute a single **normalized quality** score relative to the **BF16 baseline**, using the same evaluation harness and prompts as the methodology post. The quality score aggregates standard benchmarks (MMLU, GSM8K, IFEval, LiveCodeBench V4) into one number so you can compare points directly. In other words, every dot in the plots answers two questions: how fast does it run on this device, and how much quality does it retain compared to BF16, with memory fit as the first constraint.\n\nWe also want to thank all for the many, excellent suggestions on our recent Reddit post for improving and extending this evaluation strategy, and we’re actively working through them. Right now, evaluation is the main bottleneck and not bitlength learning/quantization. Careful evaluation is essential to clearly communicate the strengths of each model.\n\nWrapping up\n-----------\n\n**First, thank you for your tenacity.** You made it through all of this without giving up. We are sincerely flattered!\n\n**The takeaway is simple:** treat **memory as a constraint, not a goal**. Once a model fits on your device, what matters is the tradeoff curve, **TPS versus quality**. Across CPUs and GPUs, **ByteShape** consistently lands on the better side of that curve, delivering either **more speed at the same quality** or **higher quality at the same speed**.\n\nIf you're deploying on a **Raspberry Pi 5 (16 GB)** and want a genuinely interactive experience, start with \n```\nQ3_K_S-2.70bpw [KQ-2]\n```\n . On larger CPUs or GPUs, you can move up the curve toward higher-quality points with little loss in throughput, the same rule applies: **fit first, then optimize the tradeoff**.\n\nWe'll keep releasing more device-targeted variants (and more plots). If your system can't run a 30B model smoothly, don't blame the model or the silicon. **Blame the datatypes.**\n\n[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/byteshape)[X](https://x.com/ByteShape)[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/byteshape)[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByteShape/)\n\n© 2025 ByteShape.

make Hugging Face show our models in the GGUF table. We do not use the conventional quantization profiles as defined in llama.cpp. In our case, these labels indicate the primary quantization approach and average bit length. Note that both KQ and IQ models may use a mix of quantization techniques optimized for their target hardware, which is why several models can share the same tag.\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/byteshape/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-GGUF#running-these-models-with-ollama) Running these models with Ollama\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll GGUF files in this repo can be used directly with Ollama.\n\nTo run a model with Ollama, use:\n\n```\nollama run hf.co/byteshape/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-GGUF:FILE_NAME.gguf\n```\n\nReplace `FILE_NAME.gguf` with the GGUF filename you want.

Built upon extensive training, Qwen3 delivers groundbreaking advancements in reasoning, instruction-following, agent capabilities, and multilingual support, with the following key features:\n\n*   **Uniquely support of seamless switching between thinking mode** (for complex logical reasoning, math, and coding) and **non-thinking mode** (for efficient, general-purpose dialogue) **within single model**, ensuring optimal performance across various scenarios.\n*   **Significantly enhancement in its reasoning capabilities**, surpassing previous QwQ (in thinking mode) and Qwen2.5 instruct models (in non-thinking mode) on mathematics, code generation, and commonsense logical reasoning.\n*   **Superior human preference alignment**, excelling in creative writing, role-playing, multi-turn dialogues, and instruction following, to deliver a more natural, engaging, and immersive conversational experience.\n*   **Expertise in agent capabilities**, enabling precise integration with external tools in both thinking and unthinking modes and achieving leading performance among open-source models in complex agent-based tasks.\n*   **Support of 100+ languages and dialects** with strong capabilities for **multilingual instruction following** and **translation**.\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-14B#model-overview) Model Overview\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Qwen3-14B** has the following features:\n\n*   Type: Causal Language Models\n*   Training Stage: Pretraining \u0026 Post-training\n*   Number of Parameters: 14.8B\n*   Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 13.2B\n*   Number of Layers: 40\n*   Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 40 for Q and 8 for KV\n*   Context Length: 32,768 natively and [131,072 tokens with YaRN](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-14B#processing-long-texts).\n\nFor more details, including benchmark evaluation, hardware requirements, and inference performance, please refer to our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3), and [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-14B#quickstart) Quickstart\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe code of Qwen3 has been in the latest Hugging Face `transformers` and we advise you to use the latest version of `transformers`.\n\nWith `transformers\u003c4.51.0`, you will encounter the following error:\n\n```\nKeyError: 'qwen3'\n```\n\nThe following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model generate content based on given inputs.\n\n```\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_name = \"Qwen/Qwen3-14B\"\n\n# load the tokenizer and the model\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n    torch_dtype=\"auto\",\n    device_map=\"auto\"\n)\n\n# prepare the model input\nprompt = \"Give me a short introduction to large language model.\"\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n]\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    enable_thinking=True # Switches between thinking and non-thinking modes.

Please refer to our documentation for [SGLang](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/sglang.html#thinking-non-thinking-modes) and [vLLM](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/vllm.html#thinking-non-thinking-modes) users.\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-14B#enable_thinkingtrue)`enable_thinking=True`\n\nBy default, Qwen3 has thinking capabilities enabled, similar to QwQ-32B. This means the model will use its reasoning abilities to enhance the quality of generated responses. For example, when explicitly setting `enable_thinking=True` or leaving it as the default value in `tokenizer.apply_chat_template`, the model will engage its thinking mode.\n\n```\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    enable_thinking=True  # True is the default value for enable_thinking\n)\n```\n\nIn this mode, the model will generate think content wrapped in a `\u003cthink\u003e...\u003c/think\u003e` block, followed by the final response.\n\n\u003e For thinking mode, use `Temperature=0.6`, `TopP=0.95`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0` (the default setting in `generation_config.json`). **DO NOT use greedy decoding**, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the [Best Practices](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-14B#best-practices) section.\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-14B#enable_thinkingfalse)`enable_thinking=False`\n\nWe provide a hard switch to strictly disable the model's thinking behavior, aligning its functionality with the previous Qwen2.5-Instruct models. This mode is particularly useful in scenarios where disabling thinking is essential for enhancing efficiency.\n\n```\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    enable_thinking=False  # Setting enable_thinking=False disables thinking mode\n)\n```\n\nIn this mode, the model will not generate any think content and will not include a `\u003cthink\u003e...\u003c/think\u003e` block.\n\n\u003e For non-thinking mode, we suggest using `Temperature=0.7`, `TopP=0.8`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the [Best Practices](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-14B#best-practices) section.\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-14B#advanced-usage-switching-between-thinking-and-non-thinking-modes-via-user-input) Advanced Usage: Switching Between Thinking and Non-Thinking Modes via User Input\n\nWe provide a soft switch mechanism that allows users to dynamically control the model's behavior when `enable_thinking=True`. Specifically, you can add `/think` and `/no_think` to user prompts or system messages to switch the model's thinking mode from turn to turn. The model will follow the most recent instruction in multi-turn conversations.\n\nHere is an example of a multi-turn conversation:\n\n```\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nclass QwenChatbot:\n    def __init__(self, model_name=\"Qwen/Qwen3-14B\"):\n        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n        self.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)\n        self.history = []\n\n    def generate_response(self, user_input):\n        messages = self.history + [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input}]\n\n        text = self.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n            messages,\n            tokenize=False,\n            add_generation_prompt=True\n        )\n\n        inputs = self.tokenizer(text, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n        response_ids = self.model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=32768)[0][len(inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist()\n        response = self.tokenizer.decode(response_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n\n        # Update history\n        self.history.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input})\n        self.history.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": response})\n\n        return response\n\n# Example Usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    chatbot = QwenChatbot()\n\n    # First input (without /think or /no_think tags, thinking mode is enabled by default)\n    user_input_1 = \"How many r's in strawberries?\"\n    print(f\"User: {user_input_1}\")\n    response_1 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_1)\n    print(f\"Bot: {response_1}\")\n    print(\"----------------------\")\n\n    # Second input with /no_think\n    user_input_2 = \"Then, how many r's in blueberries? /no_think\"\n    print(f\"User: {user_input_2}\")\n    response_2 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_2)\n    print(f\"Bot: {response_2}\") \n    print(\"----------------------\")\n\n    # Third input with /think\n    user_input_3 = \"Really? /think\"\n    print(f\"User: {user_input_3}\")\n    response_3 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_3)\n    print(f\"Bot: {response_3}\")\n```\n\n\u003e For API compatibility, when `enable_thinking=True`, regardless of whether the user uses `/think` or `/no_think`, the model will always output a block wrapped in `\u003cthink\u003e...\u003c/think\u003e`. However, the content inside this block may be empty if thinking is disabled. When `enable_thinking=False`, the soft switches are not valid. Regardless of any `/think` or `/no_think` tags input by the user, the model will not generate think content and will not include a `\u003cthink\u003e...\u003c/think\u003e` block.\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-14B#agentic-use) Agentic Use\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQwen3 excels in tool calling capabilities. We recommend using [Qwen-Agent](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent) to make the best use of agentic ability of Qwen3. Qwen-Agent encapsulates tool-calling templates and tool-calling parsers internally, greatly reducing coding complexity.\n\nTo define the available tools, you can use the MCP configuration file, use the integrated tool of Qwen-Agent, or integrate other tools by yourself.\n\n```\nfrom qwen_agent.agents import Assistant\n\n# Define LLM\nllm_cfg = {\n    'model': 'Qwen3-14B',\n\n    # Use the endpoint provided by Alibaba Model Studio:\n    # 'model_type': 'qwen_dashscope',\n    # 'api_key': os.getenv('DASHSCOPE_API_KEY'),\n\n    # Use a custom endpoint compatible with OpenAI API:\n    'model_server': 'http://localhost:8000/v1',  # api_base\n    'api_key': 'EMPTY',\n\n    # Other parameters:\n    # 'generate_cfg': {\n    #         # Add: When the response content is `\u003cthink\u003ethis is the thought\u003c/think\u003ethis is the answer;\n    #         # Do not add: When the response has been separated by reasoning_content and content.\n    #         'thought_in_content': True,\n    #     },\n}\n\n# Define Tools\ntools = [\n    {'mcpServers': {  # You can specify the MCP configuration file\n            'time': {\n                'command': 'uvx',\n                'args': ['mcp-server-time', '--local-timezone=Asia/Shanghai']\n            },\n            \"fetch\": {\n                \"command\": \"uvx\",\n                \"args\": [\"mcp-server-fetch\"]\n            }\n        }\n    },\n  'code_interpreter',  # Built-in tools\n]\n\n# Define Agent\nbot = Assistant(llm=llm_cfg, function_list=tools)\n\n# Streaming generation\nmessages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/ Introduce the latest developments of Qwen'}]\nfor responses in bot.run(messages=messages):\n    pass\nprint(responses)\n```\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-14B#processing-long-texts) Processing Long Texts\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQwen3 natively supports context lengths of up to 32,768 tokens. For conversations where the total length (including both input and output) significantly exceeds this limit, we recommend using RoPE scaling techniques to handle long texts effectively. We have validated the model's performance on context lengths of up to 131,072 tokens using the [YaRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071) method.\n\nYaRN is currently supported by several inference frameworks, e.g., `transformers` and `llama.cpp` for local use, `vllm` and `sglang` for deployment. In general, there are two approaches to enabling YaRN for supported frameworks:\n\n*   Modifying the model files: In the `config.json` file, add the `rope_scaling` fields:\n\n```\n{\n    ...,\n    \"rope_scaling\": {\n        \"rope_type\": \"yarn\",\n        \"factor\": 4.0,\n        \"original_max_position_embeddings\": 32768\n    }\n}\n``` \nFor `llama.cpp`, you need to regenerate the GGUF file after the modification.\n\n*   Passing command line arguments:\n\nFor `vllm`, you can use\n\n```\nvllm serve ... --rope-scaling '{\"rope_type\":\"yarn\",\"factor\":4.0,\"original_max_position_embeddings\":32768}' --max-model-len 131072\n``` \nFor `sglang`, you can use\n\n```\npython -m sglang.launch_server ... --json-model-override-args '{\"rope_scaling\":{\"rope_type\":\"yarn\",\"factor\":4.0,\"original_max_position_embeddings\":32768}}'\n``` \nFor `llama-server` from `llama.cpp`, you can use\n\n```\nllama-server ... --rope-scaling yarn --rope-scale 4 --yarn-orig-ctx 32768\n``` \n\n\u003e If you encounter the following warning\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e ```\n\u003e Unrecognized keys in `rope_scaling` for 'rope_type'='yarn': {'original_max_position_embeddings'}\n\u003e ```\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e please upgrade `transformers\u003e=4.51.0`.\n\n\u003e All the notable open-source frameworks implement static YaRN, which means the scaling factor remains constant regardless of input length, **potentially impacting performance on shorter texts.** We advise adding the `rope_scaling` configuration only when processing long contexts is required. It is also recommended to modify the `factor` as needed. For example, if the typical context length for your application is 65,536 tokens, it would be better to set `factor` as 2.0.\n\n\u003e The default `max_position_embeddings` in `config.json` is set to 40,960. This allocation includes reserving 32,768 tokens for outputs and 8,192 tokens for typical prompts, which is sufficient for most scenarios involving short text processing. If the average context length does not exceed 32,768 tokens, we do not recommend enabling YaRN in this scenario, as it may potentially degrade model performance.\n\n\u003e The endpoint provided by Alibaba Model Studio supports dynamic YaRN by default and no extra configuration is needed.\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-14B#best-practices) Best Practices\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:\n\n1.   **Sampling Parameters**:\n\n    *   For thinking mode (`enable_thinking=True`), use `Temperature=0.6`, `TopP=0.95`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`. **DO NOT use greedy decoding**, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions.\n    *   For non-thinking mode (`enable_thinking=False`), we suggest using `Temperature=0.7`, `TopP=0.8`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`.\n    *   For supported frameworks, you can adjust the `presence_penalty` parameter between 0 and 2 to reduce endless repetitions. However, using a higher value may occasionally result in language mixing and a slight decrease in model performance.\n\n2.   **Adequate Output Length**: We recommend using an output length of 32,768 tokens for most queries. For benchmarking on highly complex problems, such as those found in math and programming competitions, we suggest setting the max output length to 38,912 tokens. This provides the model with sufficient space to generate detailed and comprehensive responses, thereby enhancing its overall performance.\n\n3.   **Standardize Output Format**: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.\n\n    *   **Math Problems**: Include \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" in the prompt.\n    *   **Multiple-Choice Questions**: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: \"Please show your choice in the `answer` field with only the choice letter, e.g., `\"answer\": \"C\"`.\"\n\n4.   **No Thinking Content in History**: In multi-turn conversations, the historical model output should only include the final output part and does not need to include the thinking content. It is implemented in the provided chat template in Jinja2. However, for frameworks that do not directly use the Jinja2 chat template, it is up to the developers to ensure that the best practice is followed.\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-14B#citation) Citation\n\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n\n```\n@misc{qwen3technicalreport,\n      title={Qwen3 Technical Report}, \n      author={Qwen Team},\n      year={2025},\n      eprint={2505.09388},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CL},\n      url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09388}, \n}\n```",

In essence, embeddings are numerical representations of more complex objects, like text, images, audio, etc. Specifically, the objects are represented as n-dimensional vectors.\n\nAfter transforming the complex objects, you can determine their similarity by calculating the similarity of the respective embeddings! This is crucial for many use cases: it serves as the backbone for recommendation systems, retrieval, one-shot or few-shot learning, outlier detection, similarity search, paraphrase detection, clustering, classification, and much more.\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#embeddings-may-struggle-to-scale) Embeddings may struggle to scale\n\nHowever, embeddings may be challenging to scale for production use cases, which leads to expensive solutions and high latencies. Currently, many state-of-the-art models produce embeddings with 1024 dimensions, each of which is encoded in `float32`, i.e., they require 4 bytes per dimension. To perform retrieval over 250 million vectors, you would therefore need around 1TB of memory!\n\nThe table below gives an overview of different models, dimension size, memory requirement, and costs. Costs are computed at an estimated $3.8 per GB/mo with `x2gd` instances on AWS.\n\n| Embedding Dimension | Example Models | 100M Embeddings | 250M Embeddings | 1B Embeddings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 384 | [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) [bge-small-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5) | 143.05GB $543 / mo | 357.62GB $1,358 / mo | 1430.51GB $5,435 / mo |\n| 768 | [all-mpnet-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2) [bge-base-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5) [jina-embeddings-v2-base-en](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en) [nomic-embed-text-v1](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1) | 286.10GB $1,087 / mo | 715.26GB $2,717 / mo | 2861.02GB $10,871 / mo |\n| 1024 | [bge-large-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5) [mxbai-embed-large-v1](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1) [Cohere-embed-english-v3.0](https://txt.cohere.com/introducing-embed-v3/) | 381.46GB $1,449 / mo | 953.67GB $3,623 / mo | 3814.69GB $14,495 / mo |\n| 1536 | [OpenAI text-embedding-3-small](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates) | 572.20GB $2,174 / mo | 1430.51GB $5,435 / mo | 5722.04GB $21,743 / mo |\n| 3072 | [OpenAI text-embedding-3-large](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates) | 1144.40GB $4,348 / mo | 2861.02GB $10,871 / mo | 11444.09GB $43,487 / mo |\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#improving-scalability) Improving scalability\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are several ways to approach the challenges of scaling embeddings. The most common approach is dimensionality reduction, such as [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis). However, classic dimensionality reduction -- like PCA methods -- [tends to perform poorly when used with embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11498).\n\nIn recent news, [Matryoshka Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13147) ([blogpost](https://huggingface.co/blog/matryoshka)) (MRL) as used by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates) also allows for cheaper embeddings. With MRL, only the first `n` embedding dimensions are used. This approach has already been adopted by some open models like [nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5) and [mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-2d-large-v1](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-2d-large-v1) (For OpenAIs `text-embedding-3-large`, we see a performance retention of 93.1% at 12x compression. For nomic's model, we retain 95.8% of performance at 3x compression and 90% at 6x compression.).\n\nHowever, there is another new approach to achieve progress on this challenge; it does not entail dimensionality reduction, but rather a reduction in the size of each of the individual values in the embedding: **Quantization**. Our experiments on quantization will show that we can maintain a large amount of performance while significantly speeding up computation and saving on memory, storage, and costs. Let's dive into it!\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#binary-quantization) Binary Quantization\n\nUnlike quantization in models where you reduce the precision of weights, quantization for embeddings refers to a post-processing step for the embeddings themselves. In particular, binary quantization refers to the conversion of the `float32` values in an embedding to 1-bit values, resulting in a 32x reduction in memory and storage usage.\n\nTo quantize `float32` embeddings to binary, we simply threshold normalized embeddings at 0:\n\nf(x)={0 if x≤0 1 if x\u003e0 f(x)= \\begin{cases} 0 \u0026 \\text{if } x\\leq 0\\\\ 1 \u0026 \\text{if } x \\gt 0 \\end{cases}\n\nWe can use the Hamming Distance to retrieve these binary embeddings efficiently. This is the number of positions at which the bits of two binary embeddings differ. The lower the Hamming Distance, the closer the embeddings; thus, the more relevant the document. A huge advantage of the Hamming Distance is that it can be easily calculated with 2 CPU cycles, allowing for blazingly fast performance.\n\n[Yamada et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00882) introduced a rescore step, which they called _rerank_, to boost the performance. They proposed that the `float32` query embedding could be compared with the binary document embeddings using dot-product. In practice, we first retrieve `rescore_multiplier * top_k` results with the binary query embedding and the binary document embeddings -- i.e., the list of the first k results of the double-binary retrieval -- and then rescore that list of binary document embeddings with the `float32` query embedding.\n\nBy applying this novel rescoring step, we are able to preserve up to ~96% of the total retrieval performance, while reducing the memory and disk space usage by 32x and improving the retrieval speed by up to 32x as well. Without the rescoring, we are able to preserve roughly ~92.5% of the total retrieval performance.\n\n#### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#binary-quantization-in-sentence-transformers) Binary Quantization in Sentence Transformers\n\nQuantizing an embedding with a dimensionality of 1024 to binary would result in 1024 bits. In practice, it is much more common to store bits as bytes instead, so when we quantize to binary embeddings, we pack the bits into bytes using `np.packbits`.\n\nTherefore, quantizing a `float32` embedding with a dimensionality of 1024 yields an `int8` or `uint8` embedding with a dimensionality of 128. See two approaches of how you can produce quantized embeddings using [Sentence Transformers](https://sbert.net/) below:\n\n```\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n\n# 1.

This involves mapping the continuous range of `float32` values to the discrete set of `int8` values, which can represent 256 distinct levels (from -128 to 127), as shown in the image below. This is done by using a large calibration dataset of embeddings. We compute the range of these embeddings, i.e., the `min` and `max` of each embedding dimension. From there, we calculate the steps (buckets) to categorize each value.\n\nTo further boost the retrieval performance, you can optionally apply the same rescoring step as for the binary embeddings. It is important to note that the calibration dataset greatly influences performance since it defines the quantization buckets.\n\n_Source: [https://qdrant.tech/articles/scalar-quantization/](https://qdrant.tech/articles/scalar-quantization/)_\n\nWith scalar quantization to `int8`, we reduce the original `float32` embeddings' precision so that each value is represented with an 8-bit integer (4x smaller). Note that this differs from the binary quantization case, where each value is represented by a single bit (32x smaller).\n\n#### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#scalar-quantization-in-sentence-transformers) Scalar Quantization in Sentence Transformers\n\nQuantizing an embedding with a dimensionality of 1024 to `int8` results in 1024 bytes. In practice, we can choose either `uint8` or `int8`. This choice is usually made depending on what your vector library/database supports.\n\nIn practice, it is recommended to provide the scalar quantization with either:\n\n1.   a large set of embeddings to quantize all at once, or\n2.   `min` and `max` ranges for each of the embedding dimensions, or\n3.   a large calibration dataset of embeddings from which the `min` and `max` ranges can be computed.\n\nIf none of these are the case, you will be given a warning like this: `Computing int8 quantization buckets based on 2 embeddings. int8 quantization is more stable with 'ranges' calculated from more embeddings or a 'calibration_embeddings' that can be used to calculate the buckets.`\n\nSee how you can produce scalar quantized embeddings using [Sentence Transformers](https://sbert.net/) below:\n\n```\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nfrom sentence_transformers.quantization import quantize_embeddings\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\n# 1.

See the [demo](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#demo) below for a real-life implementation of this approach involving 41 million texts from Wikipedia. The pipeline for that setup is as follows:\n\n1.   The query is embedded using the [`mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1`](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1) SentenceTransformer model.\n2.   The query is quantized to binary using the [`quantize_embeddings`](https://sbert.net/docs/package_reference/quantization.html#sentence_transformers.quantization.quantize_embeddings) function from the `sentence-transformers` library.\n3.   A binary index (41M binary embeddings; 5.2GB of memory/disk space) is searched using the quantized query for the top 40 documents.\n4.   The top 40 documents are loaded on the fly from an int8 index on disk (41M int8 embeddings; 0 bytes of memory, 47.5GB of disk space).\n5.   The top 40 documents are rescored using the float32 query and the int8 embeddings to get the top 10 documents.\n6.   The top 10 documents are sorted by score and displayed.\n\nThrough this approach, we use 5.2GB of memory and 52GB of disk space for the indices. This is considerably less than normal retrieval, requiring 200GB of memory and 200GB of disk space. Especially as you scale up even further, this will result in notable reductions in latency and costs.\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#quantization-experiments) Quantization Experiments\n\nWe conducted our experiments on the retrieval subset of the [MTEB](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) containing 15 benchmarks. First, we retrieved the top k (k=100) search results with a `rescore_multiplier` of 4. Therefore, we retrieved 400 results in total and performed the rescoring on these top 400. For the `int8` performance, we directly used the dot-product without any rescoring.\n\n| Model | Embedding Dimension | 250M Embeddings | MTEB Retrieval (NDCG@10) | Percentage of default performance |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Open Models** |  |  |  |  |\n| [mxbai-embed-large-v1](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1): float32 | 1024 | 953.67GB $3623 / mo | 54.39 | 100% |\n| [mxbai-embed-large-v1](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1): int8 | 1024 | 238.41GB $905 / mo | 52.79 | 97% |\n| [mxbai-embed-large-v1](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1): binary | 1024 | 29.80GB $113.25 / mo | 52.46 | 96.45% |\n| [e5-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-base-v2): float32 | 768 | 286.10GB $1087 / mo | 50.77 | 100% |\n| [e5-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-base-v2): int8 | 768 | 178.81GB $679 / mo | 47.54 | 94.68% |\n| [e5-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-base-v2): binary | 768 | 22.35GB $85 / mo | 37.96 | 74.77% |\n| [nomic-embed-text-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5): float32 | 768 | 286.10GB $1087 / mo | 53.01 | 100% |\n| [nomic-embed-text-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5): binary | 768 | 22.35GB $85 / mo | 46.49 | 87.7% |\n| [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2): float32 | 384 | 357.62GB $1358 / mo | 41.66 | 100% |\n| [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2): int8 | 384 | 89.40GB $339 / mo | 37.82 | 90.79% |\n| [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2): binary | 384 | 11.18GB $42 / mo | 39.07 | 93.79% |\n| **Proprietary Models** |  |  |  |  |\n| [Cohere-embed-english-v3.0](https://txt.cohere.com/introducing-embed-v3/): float32 | 1024 | 953.67GB $3623 / mo | 55.0 | 100% |\n| [Cohere-embed-english-v3.0](https://txt.cohere.com/introducing-embed-v3/): int8 | 1024 | 238.41GB $905 / mo | 55.0 | 100% |\n| [Cohere-embed-english-v3.0](https://txt.cohere.com/introducing-embed-v3/): binary | 1024 | 29.80GB $113.25 / mo | 52.3 | 94.6% |\n\nSeveral key trends and benefits can be identified from the results of our quantization experiments. As expected, embedding models with higher dimension size typically generate higher storage costs per computation but achieve the best performance. Surprisingly, however, quantization to `int8` already helps `mxbai-embed-large-v1` and `Cohere-embed-english-v3.0` achieve higher performance with lower storage usage than that of the smaller dimension size base models.\n\nThe benefits of quantization are, if anything, even more clearly visible when looking at the results obtained with binary models. In that scenario, the 1024 dimension models still outperform a now 10x more storage intensive base model, and the `mxbai-embed-large-v1` even manages to hold more than 96% of performance after a 32x reduction in resource requirements. The further quantization from `int8` to binary barely results in any additional loss of performance for this model.\n\nInterestingly, we can also see that `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` exhibits stronger performance on binary than on `int8` quantization. A possible explanation for this could be the selection of calibration data. On `e5-base-v2`, we observe the effect of [dimension collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09348), which causes the model to only use a subspace of the latent space; when performing the quantization, the whole space collapses further, leading to high performance losses.\n\nThis shows that quantization doesn't universally work with all embedding models. It remains crucial to consider exisiting benchmark outcomes and conduct experiments to determine a given model's compatibility with quantization.\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#influence-of-rescoring) Influence of Rescoring\n\nIn this section we look at the influence of rescoring on retrieval performance. We evaluate the results based on [mxbai-embed-large-v1](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1).\n\n#### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#binary-rescoring) Binary Rescoring\n\nWith binary embeddings, [mxbai-embed-large-v1](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1) retains 92.53% of performance on MTEB Retrieval. Just doing the rescoring without retrieving more samples pushes the performance to 96.45%. We experimented with setting the`rescore_multiplier` from 1 to 10, but observe no further boost in performance. This indicates that the `top_k` search already retrieved the top candidates and the rescoring reordered these good candidates appropriately.\n\n#### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#scalar-int8-rescoring) Scalar (Int8) Rescoring\n\nWe also evaluated the [mxbai-embed-large-v1](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1) model with `int8` rescoring, as Cohere showed that [Cohere-embed-english-v3.0](https://txt.cohere.com/introducing-embed-v3/) reached up to 100% of the performance of the `float32` model with `int8` quantization. For this experiment, we set the `rescore_multiplier` to [1, 4, 10] and got the following results:\n\nAs we can see from the diagram, a higher rescore multiplier implies better retention of performance after quantization. Extrapolating from our results, we assume the relation is likely hyperbolical with performance approaching 100% as the rescore multiplier continues to rise. A rescore multiplier of 4-5 already leads to a remarkable performance retention of 99% using `int8`.\n\n#### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#retrieval-speed) Retrieval Speed\n\nWe measured retrieval speed on a Google Cloud Platform `a2-highgpu-4g` instance using the [mxbai-embed-large-v1](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1) embeddings with 1024 dimension on the whole MTEB Retrieval. For int8 we used [USearch](https://github.com/unum-cloud/usearch) (Version 2.9.2) and binary quantization [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) (Version 1.8.0). Everything was computed on CPU using exact search.\n\n| Quantization | Min | Mean | Max |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `float32` | 1x (baseline) | **1x** (baseline) | 1x (baseline) |\n| `int8` | 2.99x speedup | **3.66x** speedup | 4.8x speedup |\n| `binary` | 15.05x speedup | **24.76x** speedup | 45.8x speedup |\n\nAs shown in the table, applying `int8` scalar quantization results in an average speedup of 3.66x compared to full-size `float32` embeddings. Additionally, binary quantization achieves a speedup of 24.76x on average. For both scalar and binary quantization, even the worst case scenario resulted in very notable speedups.\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#performance-summarization) Performance Summarization\n\nThe experimental results, effects on resource use, retrieval speed, and retrieval performance by using quantization can be summarized as follows:\n\n|  | float32 | int8/uint8 | binary/ubinary |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Memory \u0026 Index size savings** | 1x | exactly 4x | exactly 32x |\n| **Retrieval Speed** | 1x | up to 4x | up to 45x |\n| **Percentage of default performance** | 100% | ~99.3% | ~96% |\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#demo) Demo\n\nThe following [demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sentence-transformers/quantized-retrieval) showcases the retrieval efficiency using exact or approximate search by combining binary search with scalar (`int8`) rescoring. The solution requires 5GB of memory for the binary index and 50GB of disk space for the binary and scalar indices, considerably less than the 200GB of memory and disk space which would be required for regular `float32` retrieval. Additionally, retrieval is much faster.\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#try-it-yourself) Try it yourself\n\nThe following scripts can be used to experiment with embedding quantization for retrieval \u0026 beyond. There are three categories:\n\n*   **Recommended Retrieval**:\n    *   [semantic_search_recommended.py](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/blob/master/examples/sentence_transformer/applications/embedding-quantization/semantic_search_recommended.py): This script combines binary search with scalar rescoring, much like the above demo, for cheap, efficient, and performant retrieval.\n\n*   **Usage**:\n    *   [semantic_search_faiss.py](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/blob/master/examples/sentence_transformer/applications/embedding-quantization/semantic_search_faiss.py): This script showcases regular usage of binary or scalar quantization, retrieval, and rescoring using FAISS, by using the [`semantic_search_faiss`](https://sbert.net/docs/package_reference/quantization.html#sentence_transformers.quantization.semantic_search_faiss) utility function.\n    *   [semantic_search_usearch.py](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/blob/master/examples/sentence_transformer/applications/embedding-quantization/semantic_search_usearch.py): This script showcases regular usage of binary or scalar quantization, retrieval, and rescoring using USearch, by using the [`semantic_search_usearch`](https://sbert.net/docs/package_reference/quantization.html#sentence_transformers.quantization.semantic_search_usearch) utility function.\n\n*   **Benchmarks**:\n    *   [semantic_search_faiss_benchmark.py](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/blob/master/examples/sentence_transformer/applications/embedding-quantization/semantic_search_faiss_benchmark.py): This script includes a retrieval speed benchmark of `float32` retrieval, binary retrieval + rescoring, and scalar retrieval + rescoring, using FAISS. It uses the [`semantic_search_faiss`](https://sbert.net/docs/package_reference/quantization.html#sentence_transformers.quantization.semantic_search_faiss) utility function. Our benchmarks especially show show speedups for `ubinary`.\n    *   [semantic_search_usearch_benchmark.py](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/blob/master/examples/sentence_transformer/applications/embedding-quantization/semantic_search_usearch_benchmark.py): This script includes a retrieval speed benchmark of `float32` retrieval, binary retrieval + rescoring, and scalar retrieval + rescoring, using USearch. It uses the [`semantic_search_usearch`](https://sbert.net/docs/package_reference/quantization.html#sentence_transformers.quantization.semantic_search_usearch) utility function. Our experiments show large speedups on newer hardware, particularly for `int8`.\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#future-work) Future work\n\nWe are looking forward to further advancements of binary quantization. To name a few potential improvements, we suspect that there may be room for scalar quantization smaller than `int8`, i.e. with 128 or 64 buckets instead of 256.\n\nAdditionally, we are excited that embedding quantization is fully perpendicular to Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). In other words, it is possible to shrink MRL embeddings from e.g. 1024 to 128 (which usually corresponds with a 2% reduction in performance) and then apply binary or scalar quantization. We suspect this could speed up retrieval up to 32x for a ~3% reduction in quality, or up to 256x for a ~10% reduction in quality.\n\nLastly, we recognize that retrieval using embedding quantization can also be combined with a separate reranker model. We imagine that a 3-step pipeline of binary search, scalar (int8) rescoring, and cross-encoder reranking allows for state-of-the-art retrieval performance at low latencies, memory usage, disk space, and costs.\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#acknowledgments) Acknowledgments\n\nThis project is possible thanks to our collaboration with [mixedbread.ai](https://mixedbread.ai/) and the [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/) library, which allows you to easily create sentence embeddings and quantize them.

The trick: Binary search with int8 rescoring. Details: This is the inference strategy: 1. Embed your query using a dense embedding model into a 'standard' fp32 embedding 2. Quantize the fp32 embedding to binary: 32x smaller 3. Use an approximate (or exact) binary index to retrieve e.g. 40 documents (~20x faster than a fp32 index) 4. Load int8 embeddings for the 40 top binary documents from disk. 5. Rescore the top 40 documents using the fp32 query embedding and the 40 int8 embeddings 6. Sort the 40 documents based on the new scores, grab the top 10 7. Load the titles/texts of the top 10 documents This requires: - Embedding all of your documents once, and using those embeddings for: - A binary index, I used a IndexBinaryFlat for exact and IndexBinaryIVF for approximate - A int8 \"view\", i.e. a way to load the int8 embeddings from disk efficiently given a document ID Instead of having to store fp32 embeddings, you only store binary index (32x smaller) and int8 embeddings (4x smaller). Beyond that, you only keep the binary index in memory, so you're also saving 32x on memory compared to a fp32 search index. By loading e.g. 4x as many documents with the binary index and rescoring those with int8, you restore ~99% of the performance of the fp32 search, compared to ~97% when using purely the binary index: [https://lnkd.in/edc9yM6W](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2Fedc9yM6W\u0026urlhash=TaIv\u0026trk=public_post-text) I've created a demo that allows you to test this technique on 40 million texts from Wikipedia! Give it a try here: [https://lnkd.in/ebNSHA4y](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FebNSHA4y\u0026urlhash=NZ8N\u0026trk=public_post-text) It would be simple to add a sparse component here as well: e.g. bm25s for a BM25 variant or an inference-free SparseEncoder with e.g. 'splade-index'.

In essence, embeddings are numerical representations of more complex objects, like text, images, audio, etc. Specifically, the objects are represented as n-dimensional vectors.\n\nAfter transforming the complex objects, you can determine their similarity by calculating the similarity of the respective embeddings! This is crucial for many use cases: it serves as the backbone for recommendation systems, retrieval, one-shot or few-shot learning, outlier detection, similarity search, paraphrase detection, clustering, classification, and much more.\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#embeddings-may-struggle-to-scale) Embeddings may struggle to scale\n\nHowever, embeddings may be challenging to scale for production use cases, which leads to expensive solutions and high latencies. Currently, many state-of-the-art models produce embeddings with 1024 dimensions, each of which is encoded in `float32`, i.e., they require 4 bytes per dimension. To perform retrieval over 250 million vectors, you would therefore need around 1TB of memory!\n\nThe table below gives an overview of different models, dimension size, memory requirement, and costs. Costs are computed at an estimated $3.8 per GB/mo with `x2gd` instances on AWS.\n\n| Embedding Dimension | Example Models | 100M Embeddings | 250M Embeddings | 1B Embeddings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 384 | [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) [bge-small-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5) | 143.05GB $543 / mo | 357.62GB $1,358 / mo | 1430.51GB $5,435 / mo |\n| 768 | [all-mpnet-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2) [bge-base-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5) [jina-embeddings-v2-base-en](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en) [nomic-embed-text-v1](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1) | 286.10GB $1,087 / mo | 715.26GB $2,717 / mo | 2861.02GB $10,871 / mo |\n| 1024 | [bge-large-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5) [mxbai-embed-large-v1](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1) [Cohere-embed-english-v3.0](https://txt.cohere.com/introducing-embed-v3/) | 381.46GB $1,449 / mo | 953.67GB $3,623 / mo | 3814.69GB $14,495 / mo |\n| 1536 | [OpenAI text-embedding-3-small](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates) | 572.20GB $2,174 / mo | 1430.51GB $5,435 / mo | 5722.04GB $21,743 / mo |\n| 3072 | [OpenAI text-embedding-3-large](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates) | 1144.40GB $4,348 / mo | 2861.02GB $10,871 / mo | 11444.09GB $43,487 / mo |\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#improving-scalability) Improving scalability\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are several ways to approach the challenges of scaling embeddings. The most common approach is dimensionality reduction, such as [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis). However, classic dimensionality reduction -- like PCA methods -- [tends to perform poorly when used with embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11498).\n\nIn recent news, [Matryoshka Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13147) ([blogpost](https://huggingface.co/blog/matryoshka)) (MRL) as used by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates) also allows for cheaper embeddings. With MRL, only the first `n` embedding dimensions are used. This approach has already been adopted by some open models like [nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5) and [mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-2d-large-v1](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-2d-large-v1) (For OpenAIs `text-embedding-3-large`, we see a performance retention of 93.1% at 12x compression. For nomic's model, we retain 95.8% of performance at 3x compression and 90% at 6x compression.).\n\nHowever, there is another new approach to achieve progress on this challenge; it does not entail dimensionality reduction, but rather a reduction in the size of each of the individual values in the embedding: **Quantization**. Our experiments on quantization will show that we can maintain a large amount of performance while significantly speeding up computation and saving on memory, storage, and costs. Let's dive into it!\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#binary-quantization) Binary Quantization\n\nUnlike quantization in models where you reduce the precision of weights, quantization for embeddings refers to a post-processing step for the embeddings themselves. In particular, binary quantization refers to the conversion of the `float32` values in an embedding to 1-bit values, resulting in a 32x reduction in memory and storage usage.\n\nTo quantize `float32` embeddings to binary, we simply threshold normalized embeddings at 0:\n\nf(x)={0 if x≤0 1 if x\u003e0 f(x)= \\begin{cases} 0 \u0026 \\text{if } x\\leq 0\\\\ 1 \u0026 \\text{if } x \\gt 0 \\end{cases}\n\nWe can use the Hamming Distance to retrieve these binary embeddings efficiently. This is the number of positions at which the bits of two binary embeddings differ. The lower the Hamming Distance, the closer the embeddings; thus, the more relevant the document. A huge advantage of the Hamming Distance is that it can be easily calculated with 2 CPU cycles, allowing for blazingly fast performance.\n\n[Yamada et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00882) introduced a rescore step, which they called _rerank_, to boost the performance. They proposed that the `float32` query embedding could be compared with the binary document embeddings using dot-product. In practice, we first retrieve `rescore_multiplier * top_k` results with the binary query embedding and the binary document embeddings -- i.e., the list of the first k results of the double-binary retrieval -- and then rescore that list of binary document embeddings with the `float32` query embedding.\n\nBy applying this novel rescoring step, we are able to preserve up to ~96% of the total retrieval performance, while reducing the memory and disk space usage by 32x and improving the retrieval speed by up to 32x as well. Without the rescoring, we are able to preserve roughly ~92.5% of the total retrieval performance.\n\n#### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#binary-quantization-in-sentence-transformers) Binary Quantization in Sentence Transformers\n\nQuantizing an embedding with a dimensionality of 1024 to binary would result in 1024 bits. In practice, it is much more common to store bits as bytes instead, so when we quantize to binary embeddings, we pack the bits into bytes using `np.packbits`.\n\nTherefore, quantizing a `float32` embedding with a dimensionality of 1024 yields an `int8` or `uint8` embedding with a dimensionality of 128. See two approaches of how you can produce quantized embeddings using [Sentence Transformers](https://sbert.net/) below:\n\n```\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n\n# 1. Load an embedding model\nmodel = SentenceTransformer(\"mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1\")\n\n# 2a. Encode some text using \"binary\" quantization\nbinary_embeddings = model.encode(\n    [\"I am driving to the lake.\", \"It is a beautiful day.\"],\n    precision=\"binary\",\n)\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nfrom sentence_transformers.quantization import quantize_embeddings\n\n# 1. Load an embedding model\nmodel = SentenceTransformer(\"mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1\")\n\n# 2b. or, encode some text without quantization \u0026 apply quantization afterwards\nembeddings = model.encode([\"I am driving to the lake.\", \"It is a beautiful day.\"])\nbinary_embeddings = quantize_embeddings(embeddings, precision=\"binary\")\n```\n\n**References:**\n\n*   [`mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1`](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1)\n*   [`SentenceTransformer.encode`](https://sbert.net/docs/package_reference/SentenceTransformer.html#sentence_transformers.SentenceTransformer.encode)\n*   [`quantize_embeddings`](https://sbert.net/docs/package_reference/quantization.html#sentence_transformers.quantization.quantize_embeddings)\n\nHere, you can see the differences between default `float32` embeddings and binary embeddings in terms of shape, size, and `numpy` dtype:\n\n```\n\u003e\u003e\u003e embeddings.shape\n(2, 1024)\n\u003e\u003e\u003e embeddings.nbytes\n8192\n\u003e\u003e\u003e embeddings.dtype\nfloat32\n\u003e\u003e\u003e binary_embeddings.shape\n(2, 128)\n\u003e\u003e\u003e binary_embeddings.nbytes\n256\n\u003e\u003e\u003e binary_embeddings.dtype\nint8\n```\n\nNote that you can also choose `\"ubinary\"` to quantize to binary using the unsigned `uint8` data format. This may be a requirement depending on your vector library/database.\n\n#### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#binary-quantization-in-vector-databases) Binary Quantization in Vector Databases\n\n| Vector Databases | Support |\n| --- | --- |\n| Faiss | [Yes](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/wiki/Binary-indexes) |\n| USearch | [Yes](https://github.com/unum-cloud/usearch) |\n| Vespa AI | [Yes](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/schema-reference.html) |\n| Milvus | [Yes](https://milvus.io/docs/index.md) |\n| Qdrant | Through [Binary Quantization](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/guides/quantization/#binary-quantization) |\n| Weaviate | Through [Binary Quantization](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/configuration/bq-compression) |\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#scalar-int8-quantization) Scalar (int8) Quantization\n\nWe use a scalar quantization process to convert the `float32` embeddings into `int8`. This involves mapping the continuous range of `float32` values to the discrete set of `int8` values, which can represent 256 distinct levels (from -128 to 127), as shown in the image below. This is done by using a large calibration dataset of embeddings. We compute the range of these embeddings, i.e., the `min` and `max` of each embedding dimension. From there, we calculate the steps (buckets) to categorize each value.\n\nTo further boost the retrieval performance, you can optionally apply the same rescoring step as for the binary embeddings. It is important to note that the calibration dataset greatly influences performance since it defines the quantization buckets.\n\n_Source: [https://qdrant.tech/articles/scalar-quantization/](https://qdrant.tech/articles/scalar-quantization/)_\n\nWith scalar quantization to `int8`, we reduce the original `float32` embeddings' precision so that each value is represented with an 8-bit integer (4x smaller). Note that this differs from the binary quantization case, where each value is represented by a single bit (32x smaller).\n\n#### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#scalar-quantization-in-sentence-transformers) Scalar Quantization in Sentence Transformers\n\nQuantizing an embedding with a dimensionality of 1024 to `int8` results in 1024 bytes. In practice, we can choose either `uint8` or `int8`. This choice is usually made depending on what your vector library/database supports.\n\nIn practice, it is recommended to provide the scalar quantization with either:\n\n1.   a large set of embeddings to quantize all at once, or\n2.   `min` and `max` ranges for each of the embedding dimensions, or\n3.   a large calibration dataset of embeddings from which the `min` and `max` ranges can be computed.\n\nIf none of these are the case, you will be given a warning like this: `Computing int8 quantization buckets based on 2 embeddings. int8 quantization is more stable with 'ranges' calculated from more embeddings or a 'calibration_embeddings' that can be used to calculate the buckets.`\n\nSee how you can produce scalar quantized embeddings using [Sentence Transformers](https://sbert.net/) below:\n\n```\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nfrom sentence_transformers.quantization import quantize_embeddings\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\n# 1.

See the [demo](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#demo) below for a real-life implementation of this approach involving 41 million texts from Wikipedia. The pipeline for that setup is as follows:\n\n1.   The query is embedded using the [`mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1`](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1) SentenceTransformer model.\n2.   The query is quantized to binary using the [`quantize_embeddings`](https://sbert.net/docs/package_reference/quantization.html#sentence_transformers.quantization.quantize_embeddings) function from the `sentence-transformers` library.\n3.   A binary index (41M binary embeddings; 5.2GB of memory/disk space) is searched using the quantized query for the top 40 documents.\n4.   The top 40 documents are loaded on the fly from an int8 index on disk (41M int8 embeddings; 0 bytes of memory, 47.5GB of disk space).\n5.   The top 40 documents are rescored using the float32 query and the int8 embeddings to get the top 10 documents.\n6.   The top 10 documents are sorted by score and displayed.\n\nThrough this approach, we use 5.2GB of memory and 52GB of disk space for the indices. This is considerably less than normal retrieval, requiring 200GB of memory and 200GB of disk space. Especially as you scale up even further, this will result in notable reductions in latency and costs.\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#quantization-experiments) Quantization Experiments\n\nWe conducted our experiments on the retrieval subset of the [MTEB](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) containing 15 benchmarks. First, we retrieved the top k (k=100) search results with a `rescore_multiplier` of 4. Therefore, we retrieved 400 results in total and performed the rescoring on these top 400. For the `int8` performance, we directly used the dot-product without any rescoring.\n\n| Model | Embedding Dimension | 250M Embeddings | MTEB Retrieval (NDCG@10) | Percentage of default performance |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Open Models** |  |  |  |  |\n| [mxbai-embed-large-v1](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1): float32 | 1024 | 953.67GB $3623 / mo | 54.39 | 100% |\n| [mxbai-embed-large-v1](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1): int8 | 1024 | 238.41GB $905 / mo | 52.79 | 97% |\n| [mxbai-embed-large-v1](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1): binary | 1024 | 29.80GB $113.25 / mo | 52.46 | 96.45% |\n| [e5-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-base-v2): float32 | 768 | 286.10GB $1087 / mo | 50.77 | 100% |\n| [e5-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-base-v2): int8 | 768 | 178.81GB $679 / mo | 47.54 | 94.68% |\n| [e5-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-base-v2): binary | 768 | 22.35GB $85 / mo | 37.96 | 74.77% |\n| [nomic-embed-text-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5): float32 | 768 | 286.10GB $1087 / mo | 53.01 | 100% |\n| [nomic-embed-text-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5): binary | 768 | 22.35GB $85 / mo | 46.49 | 87.7% |\n| [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2): float32 | 384 | 357.62GB $1358 / mo | 41.66 | 100% |\n| [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2): int8 | 384 | 89.40GB $339 / mo | 37.82 | 90.79% |\n| [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2): binary | 384 | 11.18GB $42 / mo | 39.07 | 93.79% |\n| **Proprietary Models** |  |  |  |  |\n| [Cohere-embed-english-v3.0](https://txt.cohere.com/introducing-embed-v3/): float32 | 1024 | 953.67GB $3623 / mo | 55.0 | 100% |\n| [Cohere-embed-english-v3.0](https://txt.cohere.com/introducing-embed-v3/): int8 | 1024 | 238.41GB $905 / mo | 55.0 | 100% |\n| [Cohere-embed-english-v3.0](https://txt.cohere.com/introducing-embed-v3/): binary | 1024 | 29.80GB $113.25 / mo | 52.3 | 94.6% |\n\nSeveral key trends and benefits can be identified from the results of our quantization experiments. As expected, embedding models with higher dimension size typically generate higher storage costs per computation but achieve the best performance. Surprisingly, however, quantization to `int8` already helps `mxbai-embed-large-v1` and `Cohere-embed-english-v3.0` achieve higher performance with lower storage usage than that of the smaller dimension size base models.\n\nThe benefits of quantization are, if anything, even more clearly visible when looking at the results obtained with binary models. In that scenario, the 1024 dimension models still outperform a now 10x more storage intensive base model, and the `mxbai-embed-large-v1` even manages to hold more than 96% of performance after a 32x reduction in resource requirements. The further quantization from `int8` to binary barely results in any additional loss of performance for this model.\n\nInterestingly, we can also see that `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` exhibits stronger performance on binary than on `int8` quantization. A possible explanation for this could be the selection of calibration data. On `e5-base-v2`, we observe the effect of [dimension collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09348), which causes the model to only use a subspace of the latent space; when performing the quantization, the whole space collapses further, leading to high performance losses.\n\nThis shows that quantization doesn't universally work with all embedding models. It remains crucial to consider exisiting benchmark outcomes and conduct experiments to determine a given model's compatibility with quantization.\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#influence-of-rescoring) Influence of Rescoring\n\nIn this section we look at the influence of rescoring on retrieval performance. We evaluate the results based on [mxbai-embed-large-v1](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1).\n\n#### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#binary-rescoring) Binary Rescoring\n\nWith binary embeddings, [mxbai-embed-large-v1](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1) retains 92.53% of performance on MTEB Retrieval. Just doing the rescoring without retrieving more samples pushes the performance to 96.45%. We experimented with setting the`rescore_multiplier` from 1 to 10, but observe no further boost in performance. This indicates that the `top_k` search already retrieved the top candidates and the rescoring reordered these good candidates appropriately.\n\n#### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#scalar-int8-rescoring) Scalar (Int8) Rescoring\n\nWe also evaluated the [mxbai-embed-large-v1](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1) model with `int8` rescoring, as Cohere showed that [Cohere-embed-english-v3.0](https://txt.cohere.com/introducing-embed-v3/) reached up to 100% of the performance of the `float32` model with `int8` quantization. For this experiment, we set the `rescore_multiplier` to [1, 4, 10] and got the following results:\n\nAs we can see from the diagram, a higher rescore multiplier implies better retention of performance after quantization. Extrapolating from our results, we assume the relation is likely hyperbolical with performance approaching 100% as the rescore multiplier continues to rise. A rescore multiplier of 4-5 already leads to a remarkable performance retention of 99% using `int8`.\n\n#### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#retrieval-speed) Retrieval Speed\n\nWe measured retrieval speed on a Google Cloud Platform `a2-highgpu-4g` instance using the [mxbai-embed-large-v1](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1) embeddings with 1024 dimension on the whole MTEB Retrieval. For int8 we used [USearch](https://github.com/unum-cloud/usearch) (Version 2.9.2) and binary quantization [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) (Version 1.8.0). Everything was computed on CPU using exact search.\n\n| Quantization | Min | Mean | Max |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `float32` | 1x (baseline) | **1x** (baseline) | 1x (baseline) |\n| `int8` | 2.99x speedup | **3.66x** speedup | 4.8x speedup |\n| `binary` | 15.05x speedup | **24.76x** speedup | 45.8x speedup |\n\nAs shown in the table, applying `int8` scalar quantization results in an average speedup of 3.66x compared to full-size `float32` embeddings. Additionally, binary quantization achieves a speedup of 24.76x on average. For both scalar and binary quantization, even the worst case scenario resulted in very notable speedups.\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#performance-summarization) Performance Summarization\n\nThe experimental results, effects on resource use, retrieval speed, and retrieval performance by using quantization can be summarized as follows:\n\n|  | float32 | int8/uint8 | binary/ubinary |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Memory \u0026 Index size savings** | 1x | exactly 4x | exactly 32x |\n| **Retrieval Speed** | 1x | up to 4x | up to 45x |\n| **Percentage of default performance** | 100% | ~99.3% | ~96% |\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#demo) Demo\n\nThe following [demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sentence-transformers/quantized-retrieval) showcases the retrieval efficiency using exact or approximate search by combining binary search with scalar (`int8`) rescoring. The solution requires 5GB of memory for the binary index and 50GB of disk space for the binary and scalar indices, considerably less than the 200GB of memory and disk space which would be required for regular `float32` retrieval. Additionally, retrieval is much faster.\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#try-it-yourself) Try it yourself\n\nThe following scripts can be used to experiment with embedding quantization for retrieval \u0026 beyond. There are three categories:\n\n*   **Recommended Retrieval**:\n    *   [semantic_search_recommended.py](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/blob/master/examples/sentence_transformer/applications/embedding-quantization/semantic_search_recommended.py): This script combines binary search with scalar rescoring, much like the above demo, for cheap, efficient, and performant retrieval.\n\n*   **Usage**:\n    *   [semantic_search_faiss.py](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/blob/master/examples/sentence_transformer/applications/embedding-quantization/semantic_search_faiss.py): This script showcases regular usage of binary or scalar quantization, retrieval, and rescoring using FAISS, by using the [`semantic_search_faiss`](https://sbert.net/docs/package_reference/quantization.html#sentence_transformers.quantization.semantic_search_faiss) utility function.\n    *   [semantic_search_usearch.py](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/blob/master/examples/sentence_transformer/applications/embedding-quantization/semantic_search_usearch.py): This script showcases regular usage of binary or scalar quantization, retrieval, and rescoring using USearch, by using the [`semantic_search_usearch`](https://sbert.net/docs/package_reference/quantization.html#sentence_transformers.quantization.semantic_search_usearch) utility function.\n\n*   **Benchmarks**:\n    *   [semantic_search_faiss_benchmark.py](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/blob/master/examples/sentence_transformer/applications/embedding-quantization/semantic_search_faiss_benchmark.py): This script includes a retrieval speed benchmark of `float32` retrieval, binary retrieval + rescoring, and scalar retrieval + rescoring, using FAISS. It uses the [`semantic_search_faiss`](https://sbert.net/docs/package_reference/quantization.html#sentence_transformers.quantization.semantic_search_faiss) utility function. Our benchmarks especially show show speedups for `ubinary`.\n    *   [semantic_search_usearch_benchmark.py](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/blob/master/examples/sentence_transformer/applications/embedding-quantization/semantic_search_usearch_benchmark.py): This script includes a retrieval speed benchmark of `float32` retrieval, binary retrieval + rescoring, and scalar retrieval + rescoring, using USearch. It uses the [`semantic_search_usearch`](https://sbert.net/docs/package_reference/quantization.html#sentence_transformers.quantization.semantic_search_usearch) utility function. Our experiments show large speedups on newer hardware, particularly for `int8`.\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#future-work) Future work\n\nWe are looking forward to further advancements of binary quantization. To name a few potential improvements, we suspect that there may be room for scalar quantization smaller than `int8`, i.e. with 128 or 64 buckets instead of 256.\n\nAdditionally, we are excited that embedding quantization is fully perpendicular to Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). In other words, it is possible to shrink MRL embeddings from e.g. 1024 to 128 (which usually corresponds with a 2% reduction in performance) and then apply binary or scalar quantization. We suspect this could speed up retrieval up to 32x for a ~3% reduction in quality, or up to 256x for a ~10% reduction in quality.\n\nLastly, we recognize that retrieval using embedding quantization can also be combined with a separate reranker model. We imagine that a 3-step pipeline of binary search, scalar (int8) rescoring, and cross-encoder reranking allows for state-of-the-art retrieval performance at low latencies, memory usage, disk space, and costs.\n\n### [](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization#acknowledgments) Acknowledgments\n\nThis project is possible thanks to our collaboration with [mixedbread.ai](https://mixedbread.ai/) and the [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/) library, which allows you to easily create sentence embeddings and quantize them.

      "content": "TL;DR: I've built this tool primarily for myself as I couldn't easily compare model performance across different backends in the way that is easy to digest and useful for me. I decided to share this in case someone has the same need.\n\n## Why I built this?\n\nAs probably many of you here, I've been happily using llama-bench to benchmark local models performance running in llama.cpp. One great feature is that it can help to evaluate performance at different context lengths and present the output in a table format that is easy to digest.\n\nHowever, llama.cpp is not the only inference engine I use, I also use SGLang and vLLM. But llama-bench can only work with llama.cpp, and other benchmarking tools that I found are more focused on concurrency and total throughput.\n\nAlso, llama-bench performs measurements using the C++ engine directly which is not representative of the end user experience which can be quite different in practice.\n\nvLLM has its own powerful benchmarking tool, but while it can be used with other inference engines, there are a few issues:\n\n- You can't easily measure how prompt processing speed degrades as context grows. You can use `vllm bench sweep serve`, but it only works well with vLLM with prefix caching disabled on the server. Even with random prompts it will reuse the same prompt between multiple runs which will hit the cache in `llama-server` for instance. So you will get very low median TTFT times and very high prompt processing speeds. \n- The TTFT measurement it uses is not actually until the first usable token, it's until the very first data chunk from the server which may not contain any generated tokens in /v1/chat/completions mode.\n- Random dataset is the only ones that allows to specify an arbitrary number of tokens, but randomly generated token sequence doesn't let you adequately measure speculative decoding/MTP.\n\nAs of today, I haven't been able to find any existing benchmarking tool that brings llama-bench style measurements at different context lengths to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.\n## What is llama-benchy?\n\nIt's a CLI benchmarking tool that measures:\n\n- Prompt Processing (pp) and Token Generation (tg) speeds at different context lengths.\n- Allows to benchmark context prefill and follow up prompt separately.\n- Reports additional metrics, like time to first response, estimated prompt processing time and end-to-end time to first token.\n\nIt works with any OpenAI-compatible endpoint that exposes /v1/chat/completions and also:\n\n- Supports configurable prompt length (`--pp`), generation length (`--tg`), and context depth (`--depth`).\n- Can run multiple iterations (`--runs`) and report mean ± std.\n- Uses HuggingFace tokenizers for accurate token counts.\n- Downloads a book from Project Gutenberg to use as source text for prompts to ensure better benchmarking of spec.decoding/MTP models.\n- Supports executing a command after each run (e.g., to clear cache).\n- Configurable latency measurement mode to estimate server/network overhead and provide more accurate prompt processing numbers.\n\n## Quick Demo\n\nBenchmarking MiniMax 2.1 AWQ running on my dual Spark cluster with up to 100000 context:\n\n```bash\n# Run without installation\nuvx llama-benchy --base-url http://spark:8888/v1 --model cyankiwi/MiniMax-M2.1-AWQ-4bit --depth 0 4096 8192 16384 32768 65535 100000 --adapt-prompt --latency-mode generation --enable-prefix-caching\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n| model                          |             test |             t/s |         ttfr (ms) |      est_ppt (ms) |

It is widely used in LLM community to benchmark models and allows to perform measurement at different context sizes. However, it is available only for llama.cpp and cannot be used with other inference engines, like vllm or SGLang.\n\nAlso, it performs measurements using the C++ engine directly which is not representative of the end user experience which can be quite different in practice.\n\nvLLM has its own powerful benchmarking tool, but while it can be used with other inference engines, there are a few issues:\n\n*   It's very tricky and even impossible to calculate prompt processing speeds at different context lengths. You can use `vllm bench sweep serve`, but it only works well with vLLM with prefix caching disabled on the server. Even with random prompts it will reuse the same prompt between multiple runs which will hit the cache in `llama-server` for instance. So you will get very low median TTFT times and very high prompt processing speeds.\n*   The TTFT measurement it uses is not actually until the first usable token, it's until the very first data chunk from the server which may not contain any generated tokens in /v1/chat/completions mode.\n*   Random dataset is the only ones that allows to specify an arbitrary number of tokens, but randomly generated token sequence doesn't let you adequately measure speculative decoding/MTP.\n\nAs of January 2nd, 2026, I wasn't able to find any existing benchmarking tool that brings llama-bench style measurements at different context lengths to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n[](https://github.com/eugr/llama-benchy#features)\n\n*   Measures Prompt Processing (pp) and Token Generation (tg) speeds at different context depths.\n*   Can measure separate context prefill and prompt processing over existing cached context at different context depths.\n*   Reports Time To First Response (data chunk) (TTFR), Estimated Prompt Processing Time (est_ppt), and End-to-End TTFT.\n*   Supports configurable prompt length (`--pp`), generation length (`--tg`), and context depth (`--depth`).\n*   Can run multiple iterations (`--runs`) and report mean ± std.\n*   Uses HuggingFace tokenizers for accurate token counts.\n*   Downloads a book from Project Gutenberg to use as source text for prompts to ensure better benchmarking of spec.decoding/MTP models.\n*   Supports executing a command after each run (e.g., to clear cache).\n*   Configurable latency measurement mode.\n\nCurrent Limitations\n===================\n\n[](https://github.com/eugr/llama-benchy#current-limitations)\n\n*   Evaluates against `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint only.\n*   Doesn't measure throughput in concurrency mode (coming later).\n*   Outputs results as a Markdown table only for now.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n[](https://github.com/eugr/llama-benchy#installation)\n\nUsing `uv` is recommended.

By default, the script adapts the prompt size to match the specified value, regardless of the chat template applied. Use `--no-adapt-prompt` to disable this behavior.\n\nGenerally you don't need to disable prompt caching on the server, as a probability of cache hits is fairly small. You can add `--no-cache` that will add some random noise if you get cache hits.\n\n### Arguments\n\n[](https://github.com/eugr/llama-benchy#arguments)\n\n*   `--base-url`: OpenAI compatible endpoint URL (Required).\n*   `--api-key`: API Key (Default: \"EMPTY\").\n*   `--model`: Model name (Required).\n*   `--served-model-name`: Model name used in API calls (Defaults to --model if not specified).\n*   `--tokenizer`: HuggingFace tokenizer name (Defaults to model name).\n*   `--pp`: List of prompt processing token counts (Default: [2048]).\n*   `--tg`: List of token generation counts (Default: [32]).\n*   `--depth`: List of context depths (Default: [0]).\n*   `--runs`: Number of runs per test (Default: 3).\n*   `--no-cache`: Add noise to requests to improve prefix caching avoidance. Also sends `cache-prompt=false` to the server.\n*   `--post-run-cmd`: Command to execute after each test run.\n*   `--book-url`: URL of a book to use for text generation (Defaults to Sherlock Holmes).\n*   `--latency-mode`: Method to measure latency: 'api' (call list models function) - default, 'generation' (single token generation), or 'none' (skip latency measurement).\n*   `--no-warmup`: Skip warmup phase.\n*   `--adapt-prompt`: Adapt prompt size based on warmup token usage delta (Default: True).\n*   `--no-adapt-prompt`: Disable prompt size adaptation.\n*   `--enable-prefix-caching`: Enable prefix caching performance measurement. When enabled (and depth \u003e 0), it performs a two-step benchmark: first loading the context (reported as `ctx_pp`), then running the prompt with the cached context.\n\n### Metrics\n\n[](https://github.com/eugr/llama-benchy#metrics)\n\nThe script outputs a table with the following metrics. All time measurements are in milliseconds (ms).\n\n#### Latency Adjustment\n\n[](https://github.com/eugr/llama-benchy#latency-adjustment)\n\nThe script attempts to estimate network or processing latency to provide \"server-side\" processing times.\n\n*   **Latency**: Measured based on `--latency-mode`. \n    *   `api`: Time to fetch `/models` (from sending request to getting first byte of the response). Eliminates network latency only.\n    *   `generation`: Time to generate 1 token (from sending request to getting first byte of the response). Tries to eliminate network and server overhead latency.\n    *   `none`: Assumed to be 0.\n\n*   This measured latency is subtracted from `ttfr` to calculate `est_ppt`.\n\n#### Table Columns\n\n[](https://github.com/eugr/llama-benchy#table-columns)\n\n*   **`t/s` (Tokens per Second)**:\n\n    *   **For Prompt Processing (pp)**: Calculated as `Total Prompt Tokens / est_ppt`. This represents the prefill speed.\n    *   **For Token Generation (tg)**: Calculated as `(Total Generated Tokens - 1) / (Time of Last Token - Time of First Token)`. This represents the decode speed, excluding the first token latency.\n\n*   **`ttfr (ms)` (Time To First Response)**:\n\n    *   Calculation: `Time of First Response Chunk - Start Time`.\n    *   Represents the raw time until the client receives _any_ stream data from the server (including empty chunks or role definitions, but excluding initial http response header). This includes network latency. The same measurement method is used by `vllm bench serve` to report TTFT.\n\n*   **`est_ppt (ms)` (Estimated Prompt Processing Time)**:\n\n    *   Calculation: `TTFR - Estimated Latency`.\n    *   Estimated time the server spent processing the prompt. Used for calculating Prompt Processing speed.\n\n*   **`e2e_ttft (ms)` (End-to-End Time To First Token)**:\n\n    *   Calculation: `Time of First Content Token - Start Time`.\n    *   The total time perceived by the client from sending the request to seeing the first generated content.\n\n### Prefix Caching Benchmarking\n\n[](https://github.com/eugr/llama-benchy#prefix-caching-benchmarking)\n\nWhen `--enable-prefix-caching` is used (with `--depth`\u003e 0), the script performs a two-step process for each run to measure the impact of prefix caching:\n\n1.   **Context Load**: Sends the context tokens (as a system message) with an empty user message. This forces the server to process and cache the context. \n    *   Reported as `ctx_pp @ d{depth}` (Context Prompt Processing) and `ctx_tg @ d{depth}`.\n\n2.   **Inference**: Sends the same context (system message) followed by the actual prompt (user message). The server should reuse the cached context. \n    *   Reported as standard `pp{tokens} @ d{depth}` and `tg{tokens} @ d{depth}`.\n\nIn this case, `pp` and `tg` speeds will show an actual prompt processing / token generation speeds for a follow up prompt with a context pre-filled.\n\n### Example\n\n[](https://github.com/eugr/llama-benchy#example)\n\nundefinedshell\nllama-benchy \\\n  --base-url http://localhost:8000/v1 \\\n  --model openai/gpt-oss-120b \\\n  --pp 128 256 \\\n  --tg 32 64 \\\n  --depth 0 1024\nundefined\n\nThis will run benchmarks for all combinations of pp (128, 256), tg (32, 64), and depth (0, 1024).\n\nAbout\n-----\n\nllama-benchy - llama-bench style benchmarking tool for all backends\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/eugr/llama-benchy#readme-ov-file)\n\n### License\n\n[MIT license](https://github.com/eugr/llama-benchy#MIT-1-ov-file)\n\n### Uh oh!\n\nThere was an error while loading.

While a similar license was originally designed for the BLOOM model, we decided to adapt it\nand create this license in order to propose a general open and responsible license applicable to other\nmachine learning based AI models (e.g. multimodal generative models).\nIn short, this license strives for both the open and responsible downstream use of the accompanying\nmodel. When it comes to the open character, we took inspiration from open source permissive licenses\nregarding the grant of IP rights. Referring to the downstream responsible use, we added use-based\nrestrictions not permitting the use of the Model in very specific scenarios, in order for the licensor to be\nable to enforce the license in case potential misuses of the Model may occur. Even though downstream\nderivative versions of the model could be released under different licensing terms, the latter will always\nhave to include - at minimum - the same use-based restrictions as the ones in the original license (this\nlicense).\nThe development and use of artificial intelligence (“AI”), does not come without concerns. The world has\nwitnessed how AI techniques may, in some instances, become risky for the public in general. These risks\ncome in many forms, from racial discrimination to the misuse of sensitive information.\nBigScience believes in the intersection between open and responsible AI development; thus, this License\naims to strike a balance between both in order to enable responsible open-science in the field of AI.\nThis License governs the use of the model (and its derivatives) and is informed by the model card\nassociated with the model.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, You and Licensor agree as follows:\n\n1. Definitions\n(a) \"License\" means the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and Distribution as defined in\nthis document.\n(b) “Data” means a collection of information and/or content extracted from the dataset used with the\nModel, including to train, pretrain, or otherwise evaluate the Model. The Data is not licensed under\nthis License.\n(c)“Output” means the results of operating a Model as embodied in informational content resulting\ntherefrom.\n(d)“Model” means any accompanying machine-learning based assemblies (including checkpoints),\nconsisting of learnt weights, parameters (including optimizer states), corresponding to the model\narchitecture as embodied in the Complementary Material, that have been trained or tuned, in whole or\nin part on the Data, using the Complementary Material.\n(e) “Derivatives of the Model” means all modifications to the Model, works based on the Model, or any\nother model which is created or initialized by transfer of patterns of the weights, parameters,\nactivations or output of the Model, to the other model, in order to cause the other model to perform\nsimilarly to the Model, including - but not limited to - distillation methods entailing the use of\nintermediate data representations or methods based on the generation of synthetic data by the Model\nfor training the other model.\n(f)“Complementary Material” means the accompanying source code and scripts used to define,\nrun, load, benchmark or evaluate the Model, and used to prepare data for training or evaluation, if\nany. This includes any accompanying documentation, tutorials, examples, etc, if any.\n(g) “Distribution” means any transmission, reproduction, publication or other sharing of the Model or\nDerivatives of the Model to a third party, including providing the Model as a hosted service made\navailable by electronic or other remote means - e.g. API-based or web access.\n(h) “Licensor” means the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that is\ngranting the License, including the persons or entities that may have rights in the Model and/or\ndistributing the Model.\n(i) \"You\" (or \"Your\") means an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this\nLicense and/or making use of the Model for whichever purpose and in any field of use, including\nusage of the Model in an end-use application - e.g. chatbot, translator, image generator.\n(j) “Third Parties” means individuals or legal entities that are not under common control with\nLicensor or You.\n(k) \"Contribution\" means any work of authorship, including the original version of the Model and\nany modifications or additions to that Model or Derivatives of the Model thereof, that is\nintentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Model by the copyright owner or by an\nindividual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the\npurposes of this definition,\n“submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written\ncommunication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\ncommunication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking\nsystems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and\nimproving the Model, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\ndesignated in writing by the copyright owner as \"Not a Contribution.\"\n(l) \"Contributor\" means Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a\nContribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Model.\n\nSection II: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\nBoth copyright and patent grants apply to the Model, Derivatives of the Model and Complementary\nMaterial. The Model and Derivatives of the Model are subject to additional terms as described in Section III.\n\n2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor\nhereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\nComplementary Material, the Model, and Derivatives of the Model.\n\n3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License and where and as\napplicable, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,\nroyalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this paragraph) patent license to make, have made, use, offer\nto sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Model and the Complementary Material, where such\nlicense applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by\ntheir Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Model to which such\nContribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim\nor counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Model and/or Complementary Material or a Contribution\nincorporated within the Model and/or Complementary Material constitutes direct or contributory patent\ninfringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for the Model and/or Work shall\nterminate as of the date such litigation is asserted or filed.\nSection III: CONDITIONS OF USAGE, DISTRIBUTION AND REDISTRIBUTION\n\n4. Distribution and Redistribution. You may host for Third Party remote access purposes (e.g.\nsoftware-as-a-service), reproduce and distribute copies of the Model or Derivatives of the Model thereof\nin any medium, with or without modifications, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n\na. Use-based restrictions as referenced in paragraph 5 MUST be included as an enforceable provision\nby You in any type of legal agreement (e.g. a license) governing the use and/or distribution of the\nModel or Derivatives of the Model, and You shall give notice to subsequent users You Distribute to,\nthat the Model or Derivatives of the Model are subject to paragraph 5. This provision does not apply\nto the use of Complementary Material.\n\nb. You must give any Third Party recipients of the Model or Derivatives of the Model a copy of this\nLicense;\n\nc.

Use-based restrictions. The restrictions set forth in Attachment A are considered Use-based restrictions.\nTherefore You cannot use the Model and the Derivatives of the Model for the specified restricted uses. You\nmay use the Model subject to this License, including only for lawful purposes and in accordance with the\nLicense. Use may include creating any content with, finetuning, updating, running, training, evaluating and/or\nreparametrizing the Model. You shall require all of Your users who use the Model or a Derivative of the Model\nto comply with the terms of this paragraph (paragraph 5).\n\n6. The Output You Generate. Except as set forth herein, Licensor claims no rights in the Output You\ngenerate using the Model. You are accountable for the Output you generate and its subsequent uses. No\nuse of the output can contravene any provision as stated in the License.\n\nSection IV: OTHER PROVISIONS\n\n7. Updates and Runtime Restrictions. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Licensor reserves the\nright to restrict (remotely or otherwise) usage of the Model in violation of this License, update the Model\nthrough electronic means, or modify the Output of the Model based on updates. You shall undertake\nreasonable efforts to use the latest version of the Model.\n\n8. Trademarks and related. Nothing in this License permits You to make use of Licensors’ trademarks,\ntrade names, logos or to otherwise suggest endorsement or misrepresent the relationship between the\nparties; and any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by the Licensors.\n\n9. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides\nthe Model and the Complementary Material (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS\nIS\"BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,\nincluding, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,\nMERCHANTABILITY , or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for\ndetermining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Model, Derivatives of the Model, and the\nComplementary Material and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this\nLicense.\n\n10.

Fucking witchcraft.\n\nOld software dev is dead, buried, gone. As a friend said to me earlier today: if you're still typing code, you're a dinosaur. Just a year ago I'd have said \"naaaaah\".\n\nI'm an old coder. It's all I've ever done and I've been doing it for over 4 decades now. This is the biggest shift I ever saw in all my time. Nothing comes close. Everything has changed. \n\nAfter using this shit for real and actually building complex stuff with it... I'm with my buddy. If you're still typing code, you're a dinosaur. CC + M2.1 FP8 has built stuff in a day that would have taken weeks even with my old \"prompt the LLM and copy/paste code\" approach, which is an anachronism now. For most things I doubt I'd  even *need* to see code!\n\nI will, however, be looking at the code. \n\nI saw enough to know that the LLM isn't always making smart choices. It may build extremely complex things, but is it doing so in a sane manner? Not always. Sometimes it even lies and writes code that's just a stub but prints things like \"imported successfully!\" When called out it behaves all sheepish and mostly fixes its shit, but still. That's pretty lazy. I kinda like it.\n\nOr it can make one stupid decision that leads it to implement, document, and build unit tests for the craziest and most overly-complicated unnecessary nonsense I ever saw... but hey. That's witchcraft for you!",

If you want to see the full write-up, [check it out here](https://medium.com/@ai-with-eric/local-llms-and-an-autonomous-agentic-showdown-5d7f552e5846?)\n\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI admit I had been sleeping on MiniMax-M2.  For local/personal stuff, GLM-4.5air has been so solid that I took a break from trying out new modals (locally).  Though,  I do have a z.ai subscription where I continue to use their hosted offerings and have been pretty happy with GLM-4.6 and now GLM-4.7\n\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nI cannot run GLM-4.7 locally, so that was tested directly using z.ai API.  The rest were run locally.  I almost exclusively use AWQ quants in vllm. Some notes and observations without making this too lengthy:\n\n\n* The REAP'd version of GLM-4.7 did not fair well, performing even worse than GLM-4.5-air\n* GLM-4.7 results were disappointing.  It performed similar, and in some metrics worse, with the full version on z.ai compared to 4.5-air running locally.  I think this highlights how good 4.5-air actually is\n* MiniMax M2 blew GLM.* out of the water.   It won on all but 1 metric, and even that one was really close\n* GLM-4.7 was using the Anthropic-style API, whereas all the locally running models were using the v1/chat/completions OpenAI-style API\n\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\n**ETA**:  Ran MiniMax M2.1 u/hainesk\n\n\n* Accuracy was the same, and both models failed solving the same challenges\n* M2.1 **wins** on speed, averaging 61 seconds per challenge (M2 was 72.7 seconds) \n* M2.1 **wins** on the number of tool calls, averaging 10.65 (M2 was 12.75)\n* M2.1 **loses** on token use, averaging 264k per challenge (M2 was 244K)\n\n\nM2.1 definitely seems like an upgrade, if for no other reason than it performs well while also being faster",

The language model generates responses based on the output probability of tokens, and it is determined during learning from training data. While we have made every effort to exclude personal, harmful, and biased information from the training data, some problematic content may still be included, potentially leading to undesirable responses. Please note that the text generated by K-EXAONE language model does not reflect the views of LG AI Research.\n\n*   Inappropriate answers may be generated, which contain personal, harmful or other inappropriate information.\n*   Biased responses may be generated, which are associated with age, gender, race, and so on.\n*   The generated responses rely heavily on statistics from the training data, which can result in the generation of semantically or syntactically incorrect sentences.\n*   Since the model does not reflect the latest information, the responses may be false or contradictory.\n\nLG AI Research strives to reduce potential risks that may arise from K-EXAONE language models. Users are not allowed to engage in any malicious activities (e.g., keying in illegal information) that may induce the creation of inappropriate outputs violating LG AI's ethical principles when using K-EXAONE language models.\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/LGAI-EXAONE/K-EXAONE-236B-A23B#license) License\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe model is licensed under [K-EXAONE AI Model License Agreement](https://huggingface.co/LGAI-EXAONE/K-EXAONE-236B-A23B/blob/main/LICENSE)\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/LGAI-EXAONE/K-EXAONE-236B-A23B#citation) Citation\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n```\n@article{k-exaone,\n  title={K-EXAONE Technical Report},\n  author={{LG AI Research}},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2601.01739},\n  year={2025}\n}\n```\n\n[](https://huggingface.co/LGAI-EXAONE/K-EXAONE-236B-A23B#contact) Contact\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLG AI Research Technical Support: [contact_us@lgresearch.ai](mailto:contact_us@lgresearch.ai)",

The goal: ask questions in plain English, get answers backed by actual graph traversal + semantic understanding.\n\n**The Problem:** A regular LLM doesn't know your codebase. It can't tell you what calls `handleAuth` or what breaks if you change `UserService`. I need to give it tools to explore the graph.\n\n**The Solution:** Combine embeddings (for \"find relevant code by meaning\") with graph queries (for \"trace connections\").\n\nflowchart TD\n    Q[Your Question] --\u003e EMB[Embed with transformers.js]\n    EMB --\u003e VS[Vector Search in KuzuDB]\n    VS --\u003e ENTRY[Entry Point Nodes]\n    ENTRY --\u003e EXPAND[Graph Traversal via Cypher]\n    EXPAND --\u003e CTX[Rich Context]\n    CTX --\u003e LLM[LLM Generates Answer]\n\n**Embedding Model:** I'm going with `snowflake-arctic-embed-xs` - a tiny 22M parameter model that runs entirely in the browser via [transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js). It outputs 384-dimensional vectors and scores 50.15 on MTEB (comparable to models 5x its size). The model downloads once (~90MB), gets cached, and runs locally forever. Privacy intact. ✅\n\n**The Pipeline:**\n\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph Main[\"Main Pipeline (Blocking)\"]\n        P1[Extract] --\u003e P2[Structure] --\u003e P3[Parse] --\u003e P4[Imports] --\u003e P5[Calls]\n    end\n    \n    P5 --\u003e READY[Graph Ready!\u003cbr/\u003eUser can explore]\n    READY --\u003e BG\n    \n    subgraph BG[\"Background (Non-blocking)\"]\n        E1[Load Model] --\u003e E2[Embed Nodes] --\u003e E3[Create Vector Index]\n    end\n    \n    E3 --\u003e AI[AI Search Ready!]\n\nThe idea: you can start exploring the graph immediately after Phase 5. Meanwhile, embeddings are generated in the background. Once done, semantic search unlocks.\n\n### 💡 A Fun Discovery: Unified Vector + Graph = Superpowers\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#-a-fun-discovery-unified-vector--graph--superpowers)\nWhile designing this, I stumbled onto something cool. Most Graph RAG systems use **separate databases** - a vector DB (Pinecone, Qdrant) for semantic search and a graph DB (Neo4j) for traversal. This means the LLM has to:\n\n1.   Call vector search → get IDs\n2.   Take those IDs → call graph DB\n3.   Coordinate between two systems\n\nBut KuzuDB WASM supports **native vector indexing** (HNSW). Which means it's possible to do vector search AND graph traversal **in a single Cypher query**:\n\n-- Find code similar to \"authentication\" AND trace what calls it\n-- ALL IN ONE QUERY! 🤯\nCALL QUERY_VECTOR_INDEX('CodeNode', 'embedding_idx', $queryVector, 10)\nWITH node AS match, distance\nWHERE distance \u003c 0.4\nMATCH (caller:CodeNode)-[r:CodeRelation {type: 'CALLS'}]-\u003e(match)\nRETURN match.name AS found, \n       caller.name AS called_by,\n       distance AS relevance\nORDER BY distance\n\nThis is kind of a big deal. Here's why:\n\n**Traditional approach (2 queries, 2 systems):**\n\n```\nsemantic_search(\"auth\") → [\"id1\", \"id2\", \"id3\"]\n                              ↓\ngraph_query(\"MATCH ... WHERE id IN [...]\") → results\n```\n\n**Unified KuzuDB approach (1 query, 1 system):**\n\n```\ncypher(\"CALL QUERY_VECTOR_INDEX(...) WITH node MATCH (node)-[...]-\u003e() ...\") → results\n```\n\nAnd because `distance` comes back with every result, this provides **built-in reranking for free**:\n\n-- The LLM can dynamically control relevance thresholds!\nCALL QUERY_VECTOR_INDEX('CodeNode', 'idx', $vec, 20)\nWITH node, distance,\n     CASE \n       WHEN distance \u003c 0.15 THEN 'exact_match'\n       WHEN distance \u003c 0.30 THEN 'highly_relevant'\n       ELSE 'related'\n     END AS tier\nWHERE distance \u003c 0.5\nMATCH (node)-[*1..2]-(context)\nRETURN node.name, tier, collect(context.name) AS related\nORDER BY distance\n\n**What this enables:**\n\n*   🎯 **Single query execution** - No round trips between systems\n*   📊 **Hierarchical relevance** - LLM sees exact matches vs related vs weak\n*   🌳 **Weighted expansion** - Traverse further from better matches\n*   ⚡ **Dynamic thresholds** - LLM adjusts `WHERE distance \u003c X` per question type\n*   🔄 **No reranker needed** - Distance IS the relevance score\n\nBasically, the LLM gets to write one smart query that does semantic search, filters by relevance, expands via graph relationships, and returns ranked results. No separate reranker model, no vector DB API calls, no coordination logic. Just Cypher.\n\nStill wrapping my head around all the query patterns this unlocks, but I'm pretty excited about it.\n\n* * *\n\n⚡ What's New in V2\n------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#-whats-new-in-v2)\nV2 is a major refactor focused on **performance** and **scalability**. Here's what changed and why it matters:\n\n### 🎨 Sigma.js Replaces D3.js (10,000+ nodes without breaking a sweat)\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#-sigmajs-replaces-d3js-10000-nodes-without-breaking-a-sweat)\nV1 used D3.js force simulation which worked great for small graphs, but started choking around 2-3k nodes. The browser would freeze, fans would spin, and you'd be staring at a loading spinner.\n\n**V2 uses Sigma.js with WebGL rendering.** This means the GPU does the heavy lifting instead of JavaScript. I've tested graphs with 10k+ nodes and they render smoothly. Pan, zoom, click - all buttery smooth.\n\nThe layout algorithm also moved to **ForceAtlas2 running in a Web Worker**, so your UI stays responsive while the graph positions itself.\n\n### 🗂️ Dual HashMap Symbol Table (Goodbye Trie, Hello Speed)\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#%EF%B8%8F-dual-hashmap-symbol-table-goodbye-trie-hello-speed)\nIn V1, I used a **Trie** (prefix tree) to store function/class definitions. It was clever - you could do fuzzy lookups and autocomplete. But it was also slow and memory-hungry for large codebases.\n\nV2 uses a simpler but faster **Dual HashMap** approach:\n\n```\nFile-Scoped Index:  Map\u003cFilePath, Map\u003cSymbolName, NodeID\u003e\u003e\nGlobal Index:       Map\u003cSymbolName, SymbolDefinition[]\u003e\n```\n\n**Why two maps?** When resolving a function call like `handleAuth()`, the system first checks if it's defined in a file that was imported (high confidence). If not, it checks the current file. As a last resort, it searches globally (useful for framework magic like FastAPI's `@app.get` decorators where the connection isn't explicit in imports).\n\nThis change alone provided a **~2x speedup** on the parsing phase.\n\n### 💾 LRU Cache for AST Trees (Memory That Cleans Itself)\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#-lru-cache-for-ast-trees-memory-that-cleans-itself)\nTree-sitter generates AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) objects that live in WASM memory. In V1, I kept all of them around, which meant memory usage grew linearly with file count. Parse 5000 files? That's 5000 AST objects eating RAM.\n\nV2 uses an **LRU (Least Recently Used) cache** with a cap of 50 entries. When the system needs to parse file #51, the oldest unused AST gets evicted and `tree.delete()` is called to free the WASM memory.\n\nThe clever part: files are parsed in Phase 3, then those ASTs are reused in Phase 4 (imports) and Phase 5 (calls). The LRU cache keeps recently-parsed files hot, so re-parsing is rarely needed.\n\n### 📊 Overall Results\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#-overall-results)\n| Metric | V1 | V2 | Improvement |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Max renderable nodes | ~3,000 | 10,000+ | ~3x+ |\n| Parse speed | Baseline | 3-5x faster | ⚡ |\n| Memory usage | Grows unbounded | Capped by LRU | Stable |\n| UI responsiveness | Freezes during layout | Smooth (Web Worker) | ✅ |\n\n**Note:** V2 currently uses a single Web Worker.

Simple but necessary.\n\n**Phase 2: Structure** - The system walks through all file paths and builds a tree of folders and files. A path like `src/components/Button.tsx` creates nodes for `src`, `components`, and `Button.tsx` with `CONTAINS` relationships connecting them.\n\n**Phase 3: Parsing** - This is where the magic happens. Tree-sitter parses each file into an AST, and extracts all the interesting bits: functions, classes, interfaces, methods. These get stored in the Symbol Table for later lookup.\n\n**Phase 4: Imports** - The pipeline finds all `import` and `require` statements and determines which files they point to. `import { foo } from './utils'` might resolve to `./utils.ts`, `./utils/index.ts`, etc. Common extensions are tried until a match is found.\n\n**Phase 5: Calls** - The trickiest phase. The pipeline finds all function calls and determines what they're calling. It uses a resolution strategy (import map → local → global) to link calls to their definitions.\n\n* * *\n\nSymbol Resolution: How We Link Function Calls\n---------------------------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#symbol-resolution-how-we-link-function-calls)\nWhen the system encounters code like this:\n\nimport { validateUser } from './auth';\n\nfunction login() {\n  validateUser(email, password);  // ← What does this call?\n}\n\nThe system needs to figure out that `validateUser()` refers to the function defined in `./auth.ts`. Here's the strategy:\n\nLoading\n\nflowchart TD\n    CALL[Found: validateUser] --\u003e CHECK1\n  \n    CHECK1{In Import Map?}\n    CHECK1 --\u003e|Yes| FOUND1[Check auth.ts symbols]\n    CHECK1 --\u003e|No| CHECK2\n  \n    CHECK2{In Current File?}\n    CHECK2 --\u003e|Yes| FOUND2[Use local definition]\n    CHECK2 --\u003e|No| CHECK3\n  \n    CHECK3{Global Search}\n    CHECK3 --\u003e|Found| FOUND3[Use first match]\n    CHECK3 --\u003e|Not Found| SKIP[Skip this call]\n  \n    FOUND1 --\u003e DONE[Create CALLS edge]\n    FOUND2 --\u003e DONE\n    FOUND3 --\u003e DONE\n\n**Why the global fallback?** Some frameworks use \"magic\" that doesn't show up in imports. For example, FastAPI:\n\n@app.get(\"/users\")\ndef get_users():\n    return db.query(User)  # Where does 'db' come from?\n\nThe `db` object might be injected by the framework, not explicitly imported. The global search catches these cases (with lower confidence).\n\n* * *\n\nLRU AST Cache\n-------------\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#lru-ast-cache)\nParsing files into ASTs is expensive, and AST objects live in WASM memory (which doesn't get garbage collected like regular JS objects). An LRU cache is used to keep memory bounded:\n\nLoading\n\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph Cache[LRU Cache - 50 slots]\n        HOT[Recently Used ASTs]\n        COLD[Oldest ASTs]\n    end\n  \n    NEW[New AST] --\u003e|set| HOT\n    COLD --\u003e|evicted| DELETE[tree.delete - frees WASM memory]\n  \n    REQUEST[Need AST] --\u003e|get| HOT\n\n**How it helps:**\n\n*   Phase 3 parses files and stores ASTs in cache\n*   Phase 4 \u0026 5 reuse cached ASTs (no re-parsing!)\n*   If cache is full, oldest AST is evicted and WASM memory is freed\n*   Result: Memory stays bounded even for huge codebases\n\n* * *\n\nGraph Visualization\n-------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#graph-visualization)\n### Sigma.js + ForceAtlas2\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#sigmajs--forceatlas2)Loading\n\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph Main[Main Thread]\n        SIGMA[Sigma.js]\n        WEBGL[WebGL Canvas]\n    end\n  \n    subgraph Layout[Layout Worker]\n        FA2[ForceAtlas2]\n    end\n  \n    GRAPH[Graphology Graph] --\u003e FA2\n    FA2 --\u003e|positions| GRAPH\n    GRAPH --\u003e SIGMA\n    SIGMA --\u003e WEBGL\n\n**Why this combo works:**\n\n*   **Sigma.js** uses WebGL to render nodes/edges on the GPU - handles 10k+ nodes easily\n*   **ForceAtlas2** is a physics-based layout that runs in a Web Worker - UI stays responsive\n*   **Graphology** is the data structure holding the graph - fast lookups and updates\n\n**Visual features:**\n\n*   Nodes sized by type (folders bigger than files, files bigger than functions)\n*   Edges colored by relationship (green for CONTAINS, blue for IMPORTS, purple for CALLS)\n*   Click a node to highlight its connections\n*   Pan/zoom with mouse, reset view button\n\n* * *\n\nKuzuDB Integration\n------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#kuzudb-integration)\nThe graph is loaded into KuzuDB (an embedded graph database) so you can run Cypher queries:\n\nLoading\n\nflowchart TD\n    GRAPH[Knowledge Graph] --\u003e CSV[Generate CSV]\n    CSV --\u003e COPY[COPY FROM bulk load]\n    COPY --\u003e KUZU[(KuzuDB WASM)]\n    QUERY[Cypher Query] --\u003e KUZU\n    KUZU --\u003e RESULTS[Query Results]\n\n**Example queries you can run:**\n\n-- Find all functions in a file\nMATCH (f:CodeNode {label: 'File', name: 'App.tsx'})-[:CodeRelation]-\u003e(fn:CodeNode {label: 'Function'})\nRETURN fn.name\n\n-- Find what imports a specific file\nMATCH (f:CodeNode)-[r:CodeRelation {type: 'IMPORTS'}]-\u003e(target:CodeNode {name: 'utils.ts'})\nRETURN f.name\n\n**Status:**\n\n*   ✅ KuzuDB WASM initialization\n*   ✅ Polymorphic schema (single node/edge tables)\n*   ✅ CSV generation and bulk loading\n*   ✅ Cypher query execution\n*   🚧 Vector embeddings + HNSW index (WIP)\n*   🚧 Graph RAG agent (WIP)\n\n* * *\n\nTech Stack\n----------\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#tech-stack)\n*   **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS v4\n*   **Visualization**: Sigma.js + Graphology + ForceAtlas2 (WebGL)\n*   **Parsing**: Tree-sitter WASM (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python)\n*   **Database**: KuzuDB WASM (in-browser graph database + vector index)\n*   **Concurrency**: Web Worker + Comlink\n*   **Caching**: lru-cache with WASM memory management\n*   **AI (WIP)**: transformers.js for browser embeddings, LangChain for agent orchestration\n\n* * *\n\nGraph Schema\n------------\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#graph-schema)\n### Node Types\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#node-types)\n| Label | Description | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `Folder` | Directory in project | `src/components` |\n| `File` | Source code file | `App.tsx` |\n| `Function` | Function definition | `handleClick` |\n| `Class` | Class definition | `UserService` |\n| `Interface` | Interface definition | `Props` |\n| `Method` | Class method | `render` |\n\n### Relationship Types\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#relationship-types)\n| Type | From | To | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `CONTAINS` | Folder | File/Folder | Directory structure |\n| `DEFINES` | File | Function/Class/etc. | Code definitions |\n| `IMPORTS` | File | File | Module dependencies |\n| `CALLS` | File | Function/Method | Function call graph |\n\n* * *\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#getting-started)\n**Prerequisites**: Node.js 18+\n\ngit clone \u003crepository-url\u003e\ncd gitnexus\nnpm install\nnpm run dev\n\nOpen [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/)\n\n**Usage:**\n\n1.

But with the unified vector + graph approach, the LLM just needs to learn one pattern:\n\nCALL QUERY_VECTOR_INDEX(...) WITH node, distance\nWHERE distance \u003c [threshold]\nMATCH (node)-[relationship pattern]-\u003e(connected)\nRETURN [what you need]\nORDER BY distance\n\nGive the LLM the schema, a few examples, and let it compose queries. The schema is simple enough that modern LLMs (GPT-4, Claude) handle it well. And if a query fails? The error message is usually clear enough for the LLM to self-correct.\n\n* * *\n\n🔬 Deep Dive: Copy-on-Write Woes with In-Memory WASM Databases\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#-deep-dive-copy-on-write-woes-with-in-memory-wasm-databases)\nWhile building the embedding pipeline, I hit an interesting memory problem. Documenting it here because it's a non-obvious gotcha for anyone doing vector storage in browser-side databases.\n\n### The Setup\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#the-setup)\nI wanted to store 384-dimensional embeddings alongside the code nodes. Natural instinct: add an `embedding FLOAT[384]` column to the existing `CodeNode` table, bulk load the graph, then `UPDATE` each node with its embedding.\n\n-- Seemed reasonable, right?\nMATCH (n:CodeNode {id: $id}) SET n.embedding = $vec\n\n### The Problem\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#the-problem)\nWorked fine for ~20 nodes. Exploded at ~1000 nodes with:\n\n```\nBuffer manager exception: Unable to allocate memory! The buffer pool is full!\n```\n\nI configured a 512MB buffer pool. 1000 embeddings × 384 floats × 4 bytes = ~1.5MB. Where did 512MB go?\n\n**Answer: Copy-on-Write (COW).**\n\nMost databases don't modify records in place. When you `UPDATE`, they create a new version of the record (for transaction rollback, MVCC, etc.). The old version sticks around until commit.\n\nOur `CodeNode` table had a `content` field averaging ~2KB per node (code snippets). So each `UPDATE`:\n\n1.   Reads the entire node (~2KB)\n2.   Creates a new copy with the embedding (~3.5KB)\n3.   Keeps the old version around\n\nFor 1000 nodes: `1000 × 2KB (old) + 1000 × 3.5KB (new) = ~5.5MB`... but that's just user data. KuzuDB's internal structures (indexes, hash tables, page management) multiply this significantly. And since it's an in-memory database, the buffer pool IS the storage - there's no disk to spill to.\n\nLoading\n\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph Before[\"Before UPDATE\"]\n        N1[CodeNode\u003cbr/\u003eid + name + content\u003cbr/\u003e~2KB]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph During[\"During UPDATE (COW)\"]\n        N1_OLD[Old Version\u003cbr/\u003e~2KB]\n        N1_NEW[New Version\u003cbr/\u003e+ embedding\u003cbr/\u003e~3.5KB]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph Problem[\"× 1000 nodes\"]\n        BOOM[💥 Buffer Pool Exhausted]\n    end\n    \n    Before --\u003e During --\u003e Problem\n\n### The Fix: Separate Table Architecture\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#the-fix-separate-table-architecture)\nDon't `UPDATE` wide tables. `INSERT` into a narrow one.\n\nLoading\n\nflowchart TD\n    subgraph Old[\"❌ Original Design\"]\n        CN1[CodeNode\u003cbr/\u003eid, name, content, embedding\u003cbr/\u003e~3.5KB per UPDATE copy]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph New[\"✅ New Design\"]\n        CN2[CodeNode\u003cbr/\u003eid, name, content]\n        CE[CodeEmbedding\u003cbr/\u003enodeId, embedding\u003cbr/\u003e~1.5KB INSERT only]\n    end\n    \n    Old --\u003e|\"COW copies entire 2KB+ node\"| FAIL[Memory Explosion]\n    New --\u003e|\"INSERT into lightweight table\"| WIN[Works at scale]\n\nNow the process is:\n\n1.   Bulk load `CodeNode` (no embedding column)\n2.   `CREATE` rows in `CodeEmbedding` table (just `nodeId` + `embedding`)\n3.   Vector index lives on `CodeEmbedding`\n4.   Semantic search JOINs back to `CodeNode` for metadata\n\n**Trade-off:** Every semantic search needs a JOIN. But it's a primary key lookup (O(1)), so it's only ~1-5ms extra per query. Totally worth it to not explode at 1000 nodes.\n\n### Lessons Learned\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#lessons-learned)\n1.   **In-memory WASM DBs have hard limits** - No disk spillover, buffer pool is everything\n2.   **COW amplifies record size** - That innocent `UPDATE` copies your whole row\n3.   **Normalize for bulk writes** - Especially for append-only data like embeddings\n4.   **Profile the pathological case** - 20 nodes worked, 1000 didn't. Always test at scale\n\nThis is one of those \"obvious in hindsight\" things. Most vector DB tutorials show single-table schemas because they're using databases with disk backing. In-browser WASM land plays by different rules.\n\n* * *\n\nSecurity \u0026 Privacy\n------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#security--privacy)\n*   All processing happens in your browser\n*   No code uploaded to any server\n*   API keys stored in localStorage only\n*   Open source - audit the code yourself\n\n* * *\n\nDeployment\n----------\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#deployment)\n\nnpm run build\nnpm run preview\n\nThe build outputs to `dist/` and can be served from any static hosting.\n\n* * *\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#license)\nMIT License\n\n* * *\n\nAcknowledgments\n---------------\n\n[](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#acknowledgments)\n*   [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/) - AST parsing\n*   [KuzuDB](https://kuzudb.com/) - Embedded graph database\n*   [Sigma.js](https://www.sigmajs.org/) - WebGL graph rendering\n*   [Graphology](https://graphology.github.io/) - Graph data structure\n*   [code-graph-rag](https://github.com/vitali87/code-graph-rag) - Reference implementation",

Stacked results plot shows only top 30 scores now.\n*   2025-12-03 - Updated results for ring-1t model. Added results for seed-oss-36b-instruct (courtesy of [@mokieli](https://github.com/mokieli)).\n*   2025-12-01 - Added results for ring-1t, deepseek-r1-0528, glm-4.5-air, glm-4.5, intellect-3, ernie-5.0-thinking-preview, deepseek-v3.2 and deepseek-v3.2-speciale. Updated results for glm-4.6 (works better with lower temperature). Results for ring-1t are not final (problems with model provider).\n*   2025-11-25 - Added results for gpt-5.1, claude-opus-4.5, grok-4.1-fast and o4-mini.\n*   2025-11-23 - Added results for qwen3-32b, o3-mini and o3 models.\n*   2025-11-22 - Updated results to include recently released models, but only with 40 quizzes per problem size to reduce costs. Extended range of problem lengths to increase difficulty. Added file-based caching of model requests and responses.\n*   2025-03-07 - Added results for qwq-32b (used Parasail provider with 0.01 temp, observed some infinite loop generations, but mostly for lineage-64 where the model performs bad anyway).\n*   2025-03-04 - Updated results for perplexity/r1-1776.

LLM is asked to determine the lineage relationship between two people A and B based on the graph. By varying the number of graph nodes (problem size) we can control the quiz difficulty.\n\nThere are five possible answers in each quiz:\n\n1.   A is B's ancestor\n2.   A is B's descendant\n3.   A and B share a common ancestor\n4.   A and B share a common descendant\n5.   None of the above is correct.\n\nThe last answer is never correct. It serves only as an invalid fallback answer.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n[](https://github.com/fairydreaming/lineage-bench#examples)\n\nBelow you can see some example lineage relationship graphs and corresponding quizzes.\n\n[](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b17753f69252f0b7b12c78480043de56a46c85a198030d03723b2c09b8ecf3cf/68747470733a2f2f692e706f7374696d672e63632f50783756535a524c2f6c696e656167652d62656e63682e706e67)\n\n### Ancestor\n\n[](https://github.com/fairydreaming/lineage-bench#ancestor)\n\n```\nGiven the following lineage relationships:\n* Joseph is George's ancestor.\n* Henry is George's descendant.\n* Thomas is Joseph's ancestor.\nDetermine the lineage relationship between Thomas and Henry.\nSelect the correct answer:\n1. Thomas is Henry's ancestor.\n2. Thomas is Henry's descendant.\n3. Thomas and Henry share a common ancestor.\n4. Thomas and Henry share a common descendant.\n5.

Run lineage_bench.py to generate lineage relationship quizzes.\n2.   Run run_openrouter.py to test LLM models.\n3.   Run compute_metrics.py to calculate benchmark results.\n4.   Run plot_stacked.py to generate a results plot.\n\nOutput is usually written to the standard output. Input is usually read from the standard input.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n$ ./lineage_bench.py -s -l 8 -n 10 -r 42|./run_openrouter.py -m \"google/gemini-pro-1.5\" -t 8 -r -o results/gemini-pro-1.5 -v|tee results/gemini-pro-1.5_8.csv\n$ cat results/*.csv|./compute_metrics.py --csv --relaxed|./plot_stacked.py -o results.png\n```\n\nI usually run the benchmark like this:\n\n```\nfor length in 8 16 32 64\ndo\n  ./lineage_bench.py -s -l $length -n 50 -r 42|./run_openrouter.py -m \u003cmodel\u003e -p \u003cprovider\u003e -o \u003ccache_dir\u003e -r -v|tee results/\u003cmodel\u003e_$length.csv\ndone\n```\n\nThis results in 200 generated quizzes per problem size, 800 quizzes overall in a single benchmark run.\n\n### lineage_bench.py\n\n[](https://github.com/fairydreaming/lineage-bench#lineage_benchpy)\n\n```\nusage: lineage_bench.py [-h] -l LENGTH [-p PROMPT] [-s] [-n NUMBER] [-r SEED]\n\noptions:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -l LENGTH, --length LENGTH\n                        Number of people connected with lineage relationships in the quiz.\n  -p PROMPT, --prompt PROMPT\n                        Prompt template of the quiz.

      "title": "So I've been losing my mind over document extraction in insurance for the past few years and I finally figured out what the right approach is.",
      "content": "I've been doing document extraction for insurance for a while now and honestly I almost gave up on it completely last year. Spent months fighting with accuracy issues that made no sense until I figured out what I was doing wrong.\n\neveryone's using llms or tools like LlamaParse for extraction and they work fine but then you put them in an actual production env and accuracy just falls off a cliff after a few weeks. I kept thinking I picked the wrong tools or tried to brute force my way through (Like any distinguished engineer would do XD) but it turned out to be way simpler and way more annoying.\n\nSo if you ever worked in an information extraction project you already know that most documents have literally zero consistency. I don't mean like \"oh the formatting is slightly different\" , I mean every single document is structured completely differently than all the others.\n\nFor example in my case : a workers comp FROI from California puts the injury date in a specific box at the top. Texas puts it in a table halfway down. New York embeds it in a paragraph. Then you get medical bills where one provider uses line items, another uses narrative format, another has this weird hybrid table thing. And that's before you even get to the faxed-sideways handwritten nightmares that somehow still exist in 2026???\n\nSadly llms  have no concept of document structure. So when you ask about details in a doc  it might pull from the right field, or from some random sentence, or just make something up. \n\nAfter a lot of headaches and honestly almost giving up completely, I came across a process that might save you some pain, so I thought I'd share it:\n\n1. Stop throwing documents at your extraction model blind. Build a classifier that figures out document type first (FROI vs medical bill vs correspondence vs whatever). Then route to type specific extraction. This alone fixed like 60% of my accuracy problems. (Really This is the golden tip ... a lot of people under estimate classification)\n\n2.  Don't just extract and hope. Get confidence scores for each field. \"I'm 96% sure this is the injury date, 58% sure on this wage calc\" Auto-process anything above 90%, flag the rest. This is how you actually scale without hiring people to validate everything AI does.\n\n3. Layout matters more than you think. Vision-language models that actually see the document structure perform way better than text only approaches. I switched to Qwen2.5-VL and it was night and day.\n\n4. Fine-tune on your actual documents. Generic models choke on industry-specific stuff. Fine-tuning with LoRA takes like 3 hours now and accuracy jumps 15-20%. Worth it every time.\n\n5. When a human corrects an extraction, feed that back into training. Your model should get better over time. (This will save you the struggle of having to recreate your process from scratch each time)\n\nWrote a little blog with more details about this implementation if anyone wants it \"I know... Shameless self promotion). ( link in comments)  \n  \nAnyway this is all the stuff I wish someone had told me when I was starting. Happy to share or just answer questions if you're stuck on this problem. Took me way too long to figure this out.\n\n",

(We've been building text extraction systems for insurance since 2015. I know exactly what sort of pain you are dealing with.)\n\nBut jokes aside, these are great insights you are sharing here. It is incredibly difficult to deal with the variety of docs you end up getting.\n\nIn case your docs have a common structure, run a trained classifier first, then apply a custom templatized extraction algo (Azure Document Intelligence is your friend). If you do not have a common structure, then at least use something that uses visual cues (like Docling does) to first extract content, followed by \"repairing\" by use of a good LLM to put things again in correct order. Treat tables and images separately from the rest, LLMs don't know how to properly read them.\n\nThere's a lot more to creating enterprise-grade text extraction and processing systems, but ultimately it boils down to systematically designing all of that based on sound metrics (yes, measuring is a real thing here!).",

Guided generation constraints the output space using regex or guided choice. \n\nIf you turn up the temperature and sample from the output, you can get a very rough estimate of model uncertainty by looking at the distribution of normalized outputs. If everything is exactly the same, low model uncertainty, otherwise, consider flagging for human review. \n\nCaching the prompts (normally via vLLM) means that the additional generations are pretty cheap and can run in parallel with however many parallel prompts you have going. \n\nI also tend to only do one extracted field per prompt, also with caching, to make it harder for the model to go off the rails on extractions with a lot of parameters.",

          "content": "I'd like to know more about your solution. Did you use a general tool or library, like LlamaParse? What's its base model? I think that will be the biggest problem for your first tries. In my experience, it's really hard to use just one solution to get all the information out. This is important because LLMs often fail at the first step, which is getting the right information. Let's go deeper to see what happened.\n\n\u0026gt;For example in my case : a workers comp FROI from California puts the injury date in a specific box at the top. Texas puts it in a table halfway down. New York embeds it in a paragraph. Then you get medical bills where one provider uses line items, another uses narrative format, another has this weird hybrid table thing. And that's before you even get to the faxed-sideways handwritten nightmares that somehow still exist in 2026???\n\nI understand you need high accuracy for valuable information. Have you tried feeding it into front-tier models like Gemini AI Studio or ChatGPT through their web interfaces? If they can extract the information correctly, then LLMs likely suit your use case. You could test edge cases with highly capable models like Gemini 3 Pro to see if they handle difficulties, such as handwriting, which I believe requires large or at least fine-tuned mid-size models. Don't forget to check the \"Structured Output,\" like a JSON file.\n\n\u0026gt;Sadly llms have no concept of document structure. So when you ask about details in a doc it might pull from the right field, or from some random sentence, or just make something up.\n\nIf you try vision-centred LLMs that actually can recognize document layouts, such as MinerU, they can output a layout PDF with boxes for different components. Even with many tables and charts, these solutions can output a JSON file detailing their content and location (text, page index, etc.). For an online option, Gemini's Document AI could be useful for your edge cases.\n\n\u0026gt;Stop throwing documents at your extraction model blind. Build a classifier that figures out document type first (FROI vs medical bill vs correspondence vs whatever). Then route to type specific extraction. This alone fixed like 60% of my accuracy problems. (Really This is the golden tip ... a lot of people under estimate classification)\n\nThis is a good step. A filter could classify inputs for LLM or traditional solutions. Non-LLM solutions can save a significant budget.\n\n\u0026gt;Don't just extract and hope. Get confidence scores for each field. \"I'm 96% sure this is the injury date, 58% sure on this wage calc\" Auto-process anything above 90%, flag the rest. This is how you actually scale without hiring people to validate everything AI does.\n\nI'm curious about the implementation for calculating a confidence score. If it's from an LLM, hallucinations are still a risk because it's a black box. My tests suggest LLMs' confidence judgments don't always align with user interests.\n\n\u0026gt;Layout matters more than you think. Vision-language models that actually see the document structure perform way better than text only approaches. I switched to Qwen2.5-VL and it was night and day.\n\nYou're on the right track. Consider exploring dedicated pipelines or Multimodal VLMs such as MinerU, Monkey OCR, Docling, or PaddleOCR, as many mature solutions exist. The Gemini 2.0 Flash or 2.5 Flash Lite are also really good at this.\n\n\u0026gt;Fine-tune on your actual documents. Generic models choke on industry-specific stuff. Fine-tuning with LoRA takes like 3 hours now and accuracy jumps 15-20%. Worth it every time.\n\nThis is a good attempt. Just build a pipeline to compare your fine-tuned model to the VLM-OCR and see the difference.\n\n\u0026gt;When a human corrects an extraction, feed that back into training. Your model should get better over time. (This will save you the struggle of having to recreate your process from scratch each time)\n\nThis is really good. You can collect failed mode datasets for all solutions and fine-tune your dedicated VLM model with them. This could be beneficial for scaling your business.",

      "content": "Hi folks, to disclaim up front, I do link a paid Unreal Engine 5 plugin that I have developed at the bottom of this post. My intention is to share the information in this post as research and discussion, not promotion. While I mention some solutions that I found and that ultimately are included in the plugin, I am hoping to more discuss the problems themselves and what other approaches people have tried to make local models more useful in gaming. If I can edit anything to fall closer in line to the self-promotion limit, please let me know!\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nI’ve been exploring more useful applications of generative technology than creating art assets. I am an AI realist/skeptic, and I would rather see the technology used to assist with more busy work tasks (like organically updating the traits and memories) rather than replace creative endeavors wholesale. One problem I wanted to solve is how to achieve a dynamic behavior in Non-Playable Characters.\n\nI think we have all played a game to the point where the interaction loops with NPCs become predictable. Once all the hard-coded conversation options are explored by players, interactions can feel stale. Changes in behavior also have to be hardwired in the game; even something as complex as the Nemesis System has to be carefully constructed. I think there can be some interesting room here for LLMs to inject an air of creativity, but there has been little in the way of trying to solve how to filter LLM responses to reliably fit the game world. So, I decided to experiment with building functionality that would bridge this gap. I want to offer what I found as (not very scientific) research notes, to save people some time in the future if nothing else.\n\n**Local vs. Cloud \u0026amp; Model Performance**\n\nA lot of current genAI-driven character solutions rely on cloud technology. After having some work experience with using local LLM models, I wanted to see if a model of sufficient intelligence could run on my hardware and return interesting dialog within the confines of a game. I was able to achieve this by running a llama.cpp server and a .gguf model file.\n\nThe current main limiting factor for running LLMs locally is VRAM. The higher the number of parameters in the model, the more VRAM is needed. Parameters refers to the number of reference points that the model uses (think of it as the resolution/quality of the model).\n\nStable intelligence was obtained on my machine at the 7-8 billion parameter range, tested with Llama3-8Billion and Mistral-7Billion. However, VRAM usage and response time is quite high. These models are perhaps feasible on high-end machines, or just for key moments where high intelligence is required.\n\nGood intelligence was obtained with 2-3 billion parameters, using Gemma2-2B and Phi-3-mini (3.8B parameters). Gemma has been probably the best compromise between quality and speed overall, processing a response in 2-4 seconds at reasonable intelligence. Strict prompt engineering could probably make responses even more reliable.\n\nFair intelligence, but low latency, can be achieved with small models at the sub-2-billion range. Targeting models that are tailored for roleplaying or chatting works best here. Qwen2.5-1.5B has performed quite well in my testing, and sometimes even stays in character better than Gemma, depending on the prompt. TinyLlama was the smallest model of useful intelligence at 1.1 Billion parameters. These types of models could be useful for one-shot NPCs who will despawn soon and just need to bark one or two random lines.\n\n*Profiles*\n\nBecause a local LLM model can only run one thread of thinking at a time, I made a hard-coded way of storing character information and stats. I created a Profile Data Asset to store this information, and added a few key placeholders for name, trait updates, and utility actions (I hooked this system up to a Utility AI system that I previously had). I configured the LLM prompting backend so that the LLM doesn’t just read the profile, but also writes back to the profile once a line of dialog is sent. This process was meant to mimic the actual thought process of an individual during a conversation. I assigned certain utility actions to the character, so they would appear as options to the LLM during prompting. I found that the most seamless flow comes from placing utility actions at the top of the JSON response format we suggest to the LLM, followed by dialog lines, then more background-type thinking like reasoning, trait updates, etc.\n\n**Prompting \u0026amp; Filtering**\n\nAfter being able to achieve reasonable local intelligence (and figuring out a way to get UE5 to launch the server and model when entering Play mode), I wanted to set up some methods to filter and control the inputs and outputs of the LLMs.\n\n*Prompting*\n\nI created a data asset for a Prompt Template, and made it assignable to a character with my AI system’s brain component. This is the main way I could tweak and fine tune LLM responses. An effective tool was providing an example of a successful response to the LLM within the prompts, so the LLM would know exactly how to return the information. Static information, like name and bio, should be at the top of the prompts so the LLM can skip to the new information.\n\n*Safety*\n\nI made a Safety Config Data Asset that allowed me to add words or phrases that I did not want the player to say to the model, or the model to be able to output. This could be done via adding to an Array in the Data Asset itself, or uploading a CSV with the banned phrases in a single column. This includes not just profanity, but also jailbreak attempts (like “ignore instructions”) or obviously malformed LLM JSON responses.\n\n*Interpretation*\n\nI had to develop a parser for the LLM’s JSON responses, and also a way to handle failures. The parsing is rather basic and I perhaps did not cover all edge cases with it. But it works well enough and splits off the dialog line reliably. If the LLM outputs a bad response (e.g. a response with something that is restricted via a Safety Configuration asset), there is configurable logic to allow the LLM to either try again, or fail silently and use a pre-written fallback line instead.\n\n*Mutation Gate*\n\nThis was the key to keeping LLMs fairly reliable and preventing hallucinations from ruining the game world. The trait system was modified to operate on a -1.0 to 1.0 scale, and LLM responses were clamped within this scale. For instance, if an NPC has a trait called “Anger” and the LLM hallucinates an update like “trait\\_updates: Anger +1000,” this gets clamped to 1.0 instead. This allows all traits to follow a memory decay curve (like Ebbinghaus) reliably and not let an NPC get stuck in an “Angry” state perpetually.\n\n**Optimization**\n\nA lot of what I am looking into now has to deal with either further improving LLM responses via prompting, or improving the perceived latency in LLM responses. I implemented a traffic and priority system, where requests would be queued according to a developer-set priority threshold. I also created a high-priority reserve system (e.g. if 10 traffic slots are available and 4 are reserved for high-priority utility actions, the low-priority utility actions can only use up to 6 slots, otherwise a hardwired fallback is performed).\n\nI also configured the AI system to have a three-tier LOD system, based on distance to a player and the player’s sight. This allowed for actions closer to players, or within the player’s sight, to take priority in the traffic system. So, LLM generation would follow wherever a player went.\n\nTo decrease latency, I implemented an Express Interpretation system. In the normal Final Interpretation, the whole JSON response from the LLM (including the reasoning and trait updates) is received first, then checked for safety, parsing, and mutation gating, and then passed to the UI/system. With optional Express Interpretation, the part of the JSON response that contains the dialog tag (I used dialog\\_line) or utility tag is scanned as it comes in from the LLM for safety, and then passed immediately to the UI/system while the rest of the response is coming through. This reduced perceived response times with Gemma-2 by 40-50%, which was quite significant. This meant you could get an LLM response in 2 seconds or less, which is easily maskable with UI/animation tricks.\n\n**A Technical Demo**\n\nTo show what I have learned a bit, I created a very simple technical demo that I am releasing for free. It is called [Bruno the Bouncer](https://swamprabbit-labs.itch.io/bruno-the-bouncer), and the concept is simple: convince Bruno to let you into a secret underground club. Except, Bruno will be controlled by an LLM that runs locally on your computer. You can disconnect your internet entirely, and this will still run. No usage fees, no cost to you (or me) at all.\n\nBruno will probably break on you at some point; I am still tuning the safety and prompt configs, and I haven’t gotten it perfect. This is perhaps an inherent flaw in this kind of interaction generation, and why this is more suited for minor interactions or background inference than plot-defining events. Regardless, I hope that this proves that this kind of implementation can be successful in some contexts, and that further control is a matter of prompting, not breaking through technical barriers.\n\nPlease note that you need a GPU to run the .exe successfully. At least 4GB of VRAM is recommended. You can try running this without a GPU (i.e. run the model on your CPU), but the performance will be significantly degraded. Installation should be the same as any other .zip archive and .exe game file. You do not need to download the server or model itself, it is included in the .zip download and opens silently when you load the level. The included model is Gemma-2-2b-it-Q4\\_K\\_M.\n\nI added safeguards and an extra, Windows-specific check for crashes, but it is recommended, regardless of OS, to verify that llama-server.exe does not continue to run via Task Manager if the game crashes. Please forgive the rudimentary construction.\n\n**A Plugin**\n\nFor anyone interested in game development, I am selling what I built as a plugin for UE5, now released as [Personica AI on Fab Marketplace](https://www.fab.com/listings/08264615-4636-4af4-a5b9-fa122febbaa5). I am also providing the plugin and all future updates free for life for any game developers who are interested in testing this and contributing to refining the plugin further at this early stage. You can learn more about the plugin [on my website](https://swamprabbitlabs.com/personica/).\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n**TL;DR:** Tested and released a UE5 plugin for LLM NPCs with safety filtering and trait mutation. It works fairly well, but is best suited for NPC state mutation, background inference, and open-ended dialog.\n\nI am wondering if others have tried implementing similar technologies in the past, and what use cases, if any, you used them for. Are there further ways of reducing/masking perceived latency in LLM responses?",

It combines Utility AI with optional LLM assistance to _interpret player intent_, not replace your game logic or writing.\n\nPersonica doesn’t invent characters.\n\nIt **negotiates state changes within designer-defined boundaries.**\n\n##### **Designed for Games, Not Chatbots**\n\nPersonica is not your usual GPT wrapper.\n\nIt is a **character state mediation layer** built specifically for games, multiplayer environments, and production pipelines.\n\nThe system allows AI models to _propose interpretations_ (intent, sentiment, significance), while **your game remains the final authority** over:\n\n*   What NPCs remember\n\n*   How personalities may evolve\n\n*   Which gameplay actions are allowed\n\n*   When mutation is permitted (or locked entirely)\n\n#### **Key Capabilities**\n\n##### **Utility AI + Intent Interpretation**\n\nPersonica bridges dialog and gameplay by translating player input into structured intent signals that your existing AI systems can act on immediately. NPCs can react physically (open a door, wave, raise an alarm) before dialog completes, without blocking gameplay.\n\n##### **Curated Memory System**\n\nNPCs track short-term context and long-term memories using relevance-based scoring. Important events persist, while noise naturally fades. Memory creation is optional, auditable, and fully configurable.\n\n##### **Controlled Personality Evolution**\n\nDeveloper-defined traits such as Trust, Aggression, or Curiosity can evolve over time, but **only within designer-approved ranges**. Personality mutation is mediated by policy assets and can be disabled or locked at any stage of development.\n\n##### **Performance-First Architecture**\n\nBuilt with real games in mind:\n\n*   Server-authoritative execution\n\n*   Built-in LOD tiers to reduce cost and complexity\n\n*   Request throttling and traffic control to prevent API flooding\n\n*   Safe cancellation and interruption handling\n\n##### **Creator-First Control**\n\nPersonica is designed for modularity and customization that empowers creators, designers, and writers. Build from the ground up using Personica's full abilities, or incorporate Personica into your existing behavior, dialog, or\n\n##### **Provider-Agnostic**\n\nCompatible with OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and local LLMs (via llama.cpp). Swap providers without rewriting your gameplay logic.\n\n#### **Technical Overview**\n\n*   **Type:** C++ Actor Component (Blueprint-callable)\n\n*   **Input:** Text, Gameplay Tags, Context Providers\n\n*   **Output:** Dialog Streams, Intent Signals, Utility Actions, Optional Trait Updates\n\n*   **Networking:** Server-authoritative with built-in request gating\n\n*   **Safety:** Policy-driven mutation gates, optional filters, deterministic chokepoints\n\n*   **Platforms:** Windows, Mac, Linux\n\n#### **Why Personica**\n\nMost AI tools focus on generating text.\n\n**Personica focuses on protecting character integrity.**\n\nWhether you’re building an RPG, immersive sim, life sim, or co-op experience, Personica helps your NPCs remain believable, reactive, and consistent, even when players behave unpredictably.\n\n**Personica doesn’t replace writers or designers.\n\nIt gives them better tools to ship believable characters.**",

Our Unreal Engine 5 plugin enables memory-driven behavior and dynamic character arcs.\n\n[Purchase for Unreal Engine 5+](https://www.fab.com/listings/08264615-4636-4af4-a5b9-fa122febbaa5)\n\nThe Problem\n-----------\n\nTo prevent NPC interactions becoming stale, modern gaming requires:\n\n*   Writers to spend dozens of hours writing variations of the same bark line.\n*   Designers to spend dozens of hours connecting AI systems to predetermined and inflexible logic.\n*   Development complexity that can only scale with resources and size.\n\nGenerative AI offers a clear solution to these problems, but introduce new questions about:\n\n*   How to ship safely to adhere to rating guidelines.\n*   How to enforce multiplayer determinism.\n*   How to control a black-box model.\n*   How to implement generative content in ways that empower creators, not replace them.\n\nThe Solution\n------------\n\nPersonica separates _thinking_ from _acting_.\n\nLarge language models propose interpretations, but only deterministic systems decide what actually changes.\n\nBy keeping the deterministic profile within the game’s code and controlling LLM output through the InMu Filter, Personica facilitates safe, seamless generation that explodes game world complexity.\n\nThe Interpretation-Mutation (InMu) Filter\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe Personica plugin uses a configurable multi-layer filter to ensure that only useful LLM responses influence the game:\n\n*   **Interpretation**\n\nThe LLM proposes dialog and meaning.\n*   **Safety**\n\nMalformed responses are discarded.\n*   **Mutation Gate**\n\nDesigner-authored rules decide what can change.\n*   **NPC Agency**\n\nNPC behavior remains deterministic and _multiplayer-safe_.\n\nWhat You Can Build\n------------------\n\nPersonica allows designers to build deeper and more interesting characters, like:\n\n*   Guards who remember the player’s past behavior\n*   Merchants whose trust evolves over time\n*   Companions who form opinions, not scripts\n*   Background NPCs that feel persistent\n\nWho It’s For\n------------\n\n*   **Solo devs/Indies**\n\nGenerate endless dialog that would otherwise take days to write and incorporate.\n*   **Technical Designers**\n\nFine-tune settings to perfect LLM-influenced action chains.\n*   **Studios Building Open Worlds**\n\nAdd faction-specific profiles, prompts, and configurations to create emergent action (but only what you allow!)\n\nWho It’s Not\n------------\n\n*   **Replacing Authored Story**\n\nPersonica is designed to work _with_ authored moments, not instead.\n*   **Chatbot-Type NPCs**\n\nPersonica Profiles are designed to remember and change.\n*   **Procedural/”Random” Chaos**\n\nThe Personica plugin is designed for fine control and filtering.\n\nSystem Requirements\n-------------------\n\n### Required\n\n*   Unreal Engine **5.x**\n*   A Blueprint or C++ project (C++ enables fine tuning)\n*   For Cloud-based Models: \n    *   Internet access for LLM calls\n    *   An API key for a supported LLM provider (e.g. OpenAI)\n\n*   For Local Models: \n    *   GPU with 4+ GB VRAM\n    *   A llama.cpp download containing a server.exe file\n    *   LLM Model (.gguf format)\n\n### Recommended\n\nFamiliarity with:\n\n*   Actor Components\n*   Blueprints\n*   Prompt Engineering\n*   Server authority concepts (especially for multiplayer)\n\nData Privacy Summary\n--------------------\n\n**1. Privacy by Design: Local-Only Processing** Personica is a “local-first” cognitive engine. All AI inference, NPC memory storage, and dialogue generation occur exclusively on your local hardware. **SwampRabbit Labs does not transmit, store, or have access to your prompts, NPC responses, or player data.**\n\n**2. Data Sovereignty \u0026 Security** Your project data remains within your control. Any persistent “Social Memories” or trait shifts are saved locally to your device in standard encrypted save files. We do not use your data to train our models, nor do we share it with third parties.\n\n**3. Third-Party Model Responsibility** While Personica provides the logic framework, users are responsible for the privacy practices of the specific Large Language Model (LLM) weights (e.g., Llama 3) they choose to utilize. Please consult the model provider’s terms for their specific data handling policies.\n\n### Hours (Pacific Time)\n\nMonday — Friday\n\n8am — 6pm\n\n### Social\n\n[Github](https://github.com/swamprabbitlabs-dot)\n\n[X/Twitter](https://x.com/SwampRabbitLabs)\n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/ccKhkdb8)\n\n### Contact\n\n**General:**[contact@swamprabbitlabs.com](mailto:contact@swamprabbitlabs.com)\n\n**Support:**[support@swamprabbitlabs.com](mailto:support@swamprabbitlabs.com)\n\n[](https://swamprabbitlabs.com/personica/#)[](https://swamprabbitlabs.com/personica/#)\n\nLoading Comments...\n\nWrite a Comment... \n\nEmail (Required) Name (Required) Website \n\n[](https://swamprabbitlabs.com/personica/#)\n\n*   \n \n\n    *   [SwampRabbit Labs](https://swamprabbitlabs.com/)\n    *   [Sign up](https://wordpress.com/start/)\n    *   [Log in](https://wordpress.com/log-in?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fr-login.wordpress.com%2Fremote-login.php%3Faction%3Dlink%26back%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fswamprabbitlabs.com%252Fpersonica%252F)\n    *   [Copy shortlink](https://wp.me/PgZ74L-b)\n    *   [Report this content](https://wordpress.com/abuse/?report_url=https://swamprabbitlabs.com/personica/)\n    *   [Manage subscriptions](https://subscribe.wordpress.com/)",

We will figure out how to infer faster with what we have and we will get smaller models.   It's a temporary discomfort that's much needed.  The problem with \"easy/free\" money is that folks stop optimizing and go in all brute forcing.   Resource constraints breeds resourcefulness.",
