# Curator – Personal Intelligence Platform for Thought Leaders

## 1. Vision Statement  
Curator empowers thought leaders and emerging influencers to maintain their competitive edge by transforming scattered information into structured intelligence, enabling both human insight and AI-assisted analysis of the trends shaping tomorrow.

## 2. Problem Statement  
### The Information Quality Crisis
Modern information consumption is broken:
- **Engagement-driven algorithms** prioritize viral content over accuracy
- **Quality sources are scattered** across hostile platforms (Reddit's signal-to-noise, Twitter's toxicity)
- **Traditional media succumbs** to clickbait economics despite editorial standards
- **Grifters and bad actors** flood topical discussions with misinformation
- **Users lack control** over filtering and curation beyond platform-provided algorithms

### The Intelligence Gap for Leaders
Those shaping tomorrow's discourse face unique challenges:
- **Information velocity** outpaces human processing capacity
- **Cutting-edge discussions** happen across fragmented platforms before mainstream coverage
- **Context switching** between sources destroys deep thinking time
- **AI assistants lack context** on the specific information streams that inform your thinking
- **Traditional media** covers trends after they've already peaked

## 3. Solution Overview
Curator is a **personal intelligence platform** that:
- Aggregates cutting-edge discussions from multiple sources before they hit mainstream
- Applies **AI-powered quality filtering** to surface genuine insights
- Delivers **structured intelligence** in both human and AI-readable formats
- Enables **AI assistant integration** so your tools understand your information context
- Operates **entirely under your control** - your intelligence infrastructure, not a platform's
